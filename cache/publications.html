                    <div class="modal-body small">The gene encoding sortilin receptor 1 (SORL1) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk. We examined 15 SORL1 variants and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set risk scores in relation to longitudinal verbal, spatial, memory, and perceptual speed performance, testing for age trends and sex-specific effects. Altogether, 1609 individuals from 3 population-based Swedish twin studies were assessed up to 5 times across 16 years. Controlling for apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE), multiple simple and sex-moderated associations were observed for spatial, episodic memory, and verbal trajectories (p = 1.25E-03 to p = 4.83E-02). Five variants (rs11600875, rs753780, rs7105365, rs11820794, rs2070045) were associated across domains. Notably, in those homozygous for the rs2070045 risk allele, men demonstrated initially favorable performance but accelerating declines, and women showed overall lower performance. SNP set risk scores predicted spatial (Card Rotations, p = 5.92E-03) and episodic memory trajectories (Thurstone Picture Memory, p = 3.34E-02), where higher risk scores benefited men's versus women's performance up to age 75 but with accelerating declines. SORL1 is associated with cognitive aging, and might contribute differentially to change in men and women.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The feasibility to sequence entire genomes of virtually any organism provides unprecedented insights into the evolutionary history of populations and species. Nevertheless, many population genomic inferences - including the quantification and dating of admixture, introgression and demographic events, and inference of selective sweeps - are still limited by the lack of high-quality haplotype information. The newest generation of sequencing technology now promises significant progress. To establish the feasibility of haplotype-resolved genome resequencing at population scale, we investigated properties of linked-read sequencing data of songbirds of the genus Oenanthe across a range of sequencing depths. Our results based on the comparison of downsampled (25×, 20×, 15×, 10×, 7×, and 5×) with high-coverage data (46-68×) of seven bird genomes mapped to a reference suggest that phasing contiguities and accuracies adequate for most population genomic analyses can be reached already with moderate sequencing effort. At 15× coverage, phased haplotypes span about 90% of the genome assembly, with 50% and 90% of phased sequences located in phase blocks longer than 1.25-4.6 Mb (N50) and 0.27-0.72 Mb (N90). Phasing accuracy reaches beyond 99% starting from 15× coverage. Higher coverages yielded higher contiguities (up to about 7 Mb/1 Mb [N50/N90] at 25× coverage), but only marginally improved phasing accuracy. Phase block contiguity improved with input DNA molecule length; thus, higher-quality DNA may help keeping sequencing costs at bay. In conclusion, even for organisms with gigabase-sized genomes like birds, linked-read sequencing at moderate depth opens an affordable avenue towards haplotype-resolved genome resequencing at population scale.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Introduction. Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), but some cases may test HPV-negative. We previously tested 2850 Swedish cases and found that 394/2850 (13.8 %) cases tested HPV DNA-negative by PCR. Sequencing is the most thorough method to assess HPV status.Aim.. We wished to assess whether deep sequencing might detect HPV sequences among these HPV-negative cervical cancer specimens, and to increase the likelihood of detecting transcriptionally active infections.Methodology. Out of the 2850 cancer cases, we sequenced a random sample of 92 HPV PCR-negative cervical cancers and 34 HPV PCR-positive cervical cancers. Four pools of blank blocks were sequenced as negative controls. To enrich for mRNA - a hallmark of active viral infection - the samples were extracted, reverse-transcribed, rRNA-depleted and then sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina, USA). High-quality reads were aligned to the human genome and non-human reads were queried against HPV proteins.Results. We obtained a median of 23 million paired reads per sample. HPV was detected in 31/34 HPV PCR-positive cases. Among cases negative for HPV by PCR, 48/92 (52.2 %) contained HPV sequences, with HPV33 being the most commonly detected type among these (14/48 cases, 29.2 %). Comparison of the ratio of exon and intron sequences found that the sequenced material contained both DNA and RNA. Splice junctions were detected in 12 cases.Conclusion. Apparently, some cervical cancers contain HPV that is difficult to detect by PCR. Sequencing may be a helpful tool for additional quality assurance for HPV testing methods.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol.

We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent.

Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.</div>

However, the molecular mechanisms by which LXRs control these functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we perform a combined transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of midbrain cells after LXR activation, followed by bioinformatic analysis to elucidate the transcriptional networks controlling mDA neurogenesis. Our results identify the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) as part of a cluster of proneural transcription factors in radial glia and as a regulator of transcription factors controlling mDA neurogenesis, such as Foxa2. Moreover, loss- and gain-of-function experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that Srebf1 is both required and sufficient for mDA neurogenesis. Our data, thus, identify Srebf1 as a central player in mDA neurogenesis.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Inflammation is a primary component of both initiation and promotion of colorectal cancer (CRC). Cytokines secreted by macrophages, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), activates the pro-survival transcription factor complex NFκB. The precise mechanism of NFκB in CRC is not well studied, but we recently reported the genome-wide transcriptional impact of TNFα in two CRC cell lines. Further, estrogen signaling influences inflammation in a complex manner and suppresses CRC development. CRC protective effects of estrogen have been shown to be mediated by estrogen receptor beta (ERβ, ESR2), which also impacts inflammatory signaling of the colon. However, whether ERβ impacts the chromatin interaction (cistrome) of the main NFκB subunit p65 (RELA) is not known. We used p65 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in two different CRC cell lines, HT29 and SW480, with and without expression of ERβ. We here present the p65 colon cistrome of these two CRC cell lines. We identify that RELA and AP1 motifs are predominant in both cell lines, and additionally describe both common and cell line-specific p65 binding sites and correlate these to transcriptional changes related to inflammation, migration, apoptosis and circadian rhythm. Further, we determine that ERβ opposes a major fraction of p65 chromatin binding in HT29 cells, but enhances p65 binding in SW480 cells, thereby impacting the p65 cistrome differently in the two cell lines. However, the biological functions of the regulated genes appear to have similar roles in both cell lines. To our knowledge, this is the first time the p65 CRC cistrome is compared between different cell lines and the first time an influence by ERβ on the p65 cistrome is investigated. Our work provides a mechanistic foundation for a better understanding of how estrogen influences inflammatory signaling through NFκB in CRC cells.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Triticum aestivum (wheat) is one of the world's oldest crops and has been used for >8000 years as a food crop in North Africa, West Asia and Europe. Today, wheat is one of the most important sources of grain for humans, and is cultivated on greater areas of land than any other crop. As the human population increases and soil salinity becomes more prevalent, there is increased pressure on wheat breeders to develop salt-tolerant varieties in order to meet growing demands for yield and grain quality. Here we developed a mutant wheat population using the moderately salt-tolerant Bangladeshi variety BARI Gom-25, with the primary goal of further increasing salt tolerance.

After titrating the optimal ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) concentration, ca 30,000 seeds were treated with 1% EMS, and 1676 lines, all originating from single seeds, survived through the first four generations. Most mutagenized lines showed a similar phenotype to BARI Gom-25, although visual differences such as dwarfing, giant plants, early and late flowering and altered leaf morphology were seen in some lines. By developing an assay for salt tolerance, and by screening the mutagenized population, we identified 70 lines exhibiting increased salt tolerance. The selected lines typically showed a 70% germination rate on filter paper soaked in 200 mM NaCl, compared to 0-30% for BARI Gom-25. From two of the salt-tolerant OlsAro lines (OA42 and OA70), genomic DNA was sequenced to 15x times coverage. A comparative analysis against the BARI Gom-25 genomic sequence identified a total of 683,201 (OA42), and 768,954 (OA70) SNPs distributed throughout the three sub-genomes (A, B and D). The mutation frequency was determined to be approximately one per 20,000 bp. All the 70 selected salt-tolerant lines were tested for root growth in the laboratory, and under saline field conditions in Bangladesh. The results showed that all the lines selected for tolerance showed a better salt tolerance phenotype than both BARI Gom-25 and other local wheat varieties tested.

The mutant wheat population developed here will be a valuable resource in the development of novel salt-tolerant varieties for the benefit of saline farming.</div>

Increasing human activity restricts animal movements and isolates formerly connected populations, a particular concern for the conservation of large carnivores, but no prior research has used high throughput sequencing in a standardized manner to examine genetic connectivity for multiple species of large carnivores and multiple ecosystems. Here, we used RAD SNP genotypes to test for differences in connectivity between multiple ecosystems for African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and lions (Panthera leo), and to test correlations between genetic distance, geographic distance and landscape resistance due to human activity. We found weaker connectivity, a stronger correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance, and a stronger correlation between genetic distance and landscape resistance for lions than for wild dogs, and propose a new hypothesis that adaptations to interspecific competition may help to explain differences in vulnerability to isolation by humans.</div>

To identify genetic markers associated with treatment-induced thrombocytopenia, we whole-exome sequenced 215 non-small cell lung cancer patients homogeneously treated with gemcitabine/carboplatin. The decrease in platelets (defined as nadir/baseline) was used to assess treatment-induced thrombocytopenia. Association between germline genetic variants and thrombocytopenia was analyzed at single-nucleotide variant (SNV) (based on the optimal false discovery rate, the severity of predicted consequence, and effect), gene, and pathway levels. These analyses identified 130 SNVs/INDELs and 25 genes associated with thrombocytopenia (P-value < 0.002). Twenty-three SNVs were validated in an independent genome-wide association study (GWAS). The top associations include rs34491125 in JMJD1C (P-value = 9.07 × 10-5), the validated variants rs10491684 in DOCK8 (P-value = 1.95 × 10-4), rs6118 in SERPINA5 (P-value = 5.83 × 10-4), and rs5877 in SERPINC1 (P-value = 1.07 × 10-3), and the genes CAPZA2 (P-value = 4.03 × 10-4) and SERPINC1 (P-value = 1.55 × 10-3). The SNVs in the top-scoring pathway "Factors involved in megakaryocyte development and platelet production" (P-value = 3.34 × 10-4) were used to construct weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) and logistic regression models that predict thrombocytopenia. The wGRS predict which patients are at high or low toxicity risk levels, for CTCAE (odds ratio (OR) = 22.35, P-value = 1.55 × 10-8), and decrease (OR = 66.82, P-value = 5.92 × 10-9). The logistic regression models predict CTCAE grades 3-4 (receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) = 0.79), and large decrease (ROC AUC = 0.86). We identified and validated genetic variations within hematopoiesis-related pathways that provide a solid foundation for future studies using genetic markers for predicting chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and personalizing treatments.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Ancient DNA provides a powerful means to investigate the timing, rate and extent of population declines caused by extrinsic factors, such as past climate change and human activities. One species probably affected by both these factors is the arctic fox, which had a large distribution during the last glaciation that subsequently contracted at the start of the Holocene. More recently, the arctic fox population in Scandinavia went through a demographic bottleneck owing to human persecution. To investigate the consequences of these processes, we generated mitogenome sequences from a temporal dataset comprising Pleistocene, historical and modern arctic fox samples. We found no evidence that Pleistocene populations in mid-latitude Europe or Russia contributed to the present-day gene pool of the Scandinavian population, suggesting that postglacial climate warming led to local population extinctions. Furthermore, during the twentieth-century bottleneck in Scandinavia, at least half of the mitogenome haplotypes were lost, consistent with a 20-fold reduction in female effective population size. In conclusion, these results suggest that the arctic fox in mainland Western Europe has lost genetic diversity as a result of both past climate change and human persecution. Consequently, it might be particularly vulnerable to the future challenges posed by climate change.

                    <div class="modal-body small">Bacterial pathogens often employ RNA regulatory elements located in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) to control gene expression. Using a comparative structural analysis, we examine the structure of 5' UTRs at a global scale in the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes under different conditions. In addition to discovering an RNA thermoswitch and detecting simultaneous interaction of ribosomes and small RNAs with mRNA, we identify structural changes in the 5' UTR of an mRNA encoding the post-translocation chaperone PrsA2 during infection conditions. We demonstrate that the 5' UTR of the prsA2 mRNA base pairs with the 3' UTR of the full-length hly mRNA encoding listeriolysin O, thus preventing RNase J1-mediated degradation of the prsA2 transcript. Mutants lacking the hly-prsA2 interaction exhibit reduced virulence properties. This work highlights an additional level of RNA regulation, where the mRNA encoding a chaperone is stabilized by the mRNA encoding its substrate.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">In wheatears and related species ('open-habitat chats'), molecular phylogenetics has led to a comprehensively revised understanding of species relationships and species diversity. Phylogenetic analyses have suggested that, in many cases, phenotypic similarities do not reflect species' relationships, revealing traditionally defined genera as non-monophyletic. This led to the suggestion of pervasive parallel evolution of open-habitat chats' plumage coloration and ecological phenotypes. However, to date, the molecular evidence for the phylogenetic relationships among open-habitat chats is mainly limited to mitochondrial DNA. Here, we assessed whether the mitochondrial relationships are supported by genome-wide data. To this end, we reconstructed the species tree among 14 open-habitat chat taxa using multi-species coalescent analyses based on ~1'300 SNPs. Our results confirm previous ones based chiefly on mitochondrial DNA; notably the paraphyly of the Oenanthe lugens complex and the clustering of individual species formerly placed in the genera Cercomela and Myrmecocichla within Oenanthe. Since several variable morphological and ecological characteristics occur in multiple places across the open-habitat chat phylogeny, our study consolidates the evidence for pervasive parallel evolution in the plumage coloration and ecology of open-habitat chats.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Soil microbial communities are major drivers of cycling of soil nutrients that sustain plant growth and productivity. Yet, a holistic understanding of the impact of land-use intensification on the soil microbiome is still poorly understood. Here, we used a field experiment to investigate the long-term consequences of changes in land-use intensity based on cropping frequency (continuous cropping, alternating cropping with a temporary grassland, perennial grassland) on bacterial, protist and fungal communities as well as on their co-occurrence networks.

We showed that land use has a major impact on the structure and composition of bacterial, protist and fungal communities. Grassland and arable cropping differed markedly with many taxa differentiating between both land use types. The smallest differences in the microbiome were observed between temporary grassland and continuous cropping, which suggests lasting effects of the cropping system preceding the temporary grasslands. Land-use intensity also affected the bacterial co-occurrence networks with increased complexity in the perennial grassland comparing to the other land-use systems. Similarly, co-occurrence networks within microbial groups showed a higher connectivity in the perennial grasslands. Protists, particularly Rhizaria, dominated in soil microbial associations, as they showed a higher number of connections than bacteria and fungi in all land uses.

Our findings provide evidence of legacy effects of prior land use on the composition of the soil microbiome. Whatever the land use, network analyses highlighted the importance of protists as a key element of the soil microbiome that should be considered in future work. Altogether, this work provides a holistic perspective of the differential responses of various microbial groups and of their associations to agricultural intensification.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Safety assessment of graphene-based materials (GBMs) including graphene oxide (GO) is essential for their safe use across many sectors of society. In particular, the link between specific material properties and biological effects needs to be further elucidated. Here, the effects of lateral dimensions of GO sheets in acute and chronic pulmonary responses after single intranasal instillation in mice are compared. Micrometer-sized GO induces stronger pulmonary inflammation than nanometer-sized GO, despite reduced translocation to the lungs. Genome-wide RNA sequencing also reveals distinct size-dependent effects of GO, in agreement with the histopathological results. Although large GO, but not the smallest GO, triggers the formation of granulomas that persists for up to 90 days, no pulmonary fibrosis is observed. These latter results can be partly explained by Raman imaging, which evidences the progressive biotransformation of GO into less graphitic structures. The findings demonstrate that lateral dimensions play a fundamental role in the pulmonary response to GO, and suggest that airborne exposure to micrometer-sized GO should be avoided in the production plant or applications, where aerosolized dispersions are likely to occur. These results are important toward the implementation of a safer-by-design approach for GBM products and applications, for the benefit of workers and end-users.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is recognized by its ability to invade the tumor capsule and blood vessels, although the exact molecular signals orchestrating this phenotype remain elusive. In this study, the spatial transcriptional landscape of an FTC is detailed with comparisons between the invasive front and histologically indolent central core tumor areas. The Visium spatial gene expression platform allowed us to interrogate and visualize the whole transcriptome in 2D across formalin-fixated paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Four different 6 × 6 mm areas of an FTC were scrutinized, including regions with capsular and vascular invasion, capsule-near area without invasion, and a central core area of the tumor. Following successful capturing and sequencing, several expressional clusters were identified with regional variation. Most notably, invasive tumor cell clusters were significantly over-expressing genes associated with pathways interacting with the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Subsets of these genes (POSTN and DPYSL3) were additionally validated using immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of follicular thyroid tumors showing a clear gradient pattern from the core to the periphery of the tumor. Moreover, the reconstruction of the evolutionary tree identified the invasive clones as late events in follicular thyroid tumorigenesis. To our knowledge, this is one of the first 2D global transcriptional mappings of FTC using this platform to date. Invasive FTC clones develop in a stepwise fashion and display significant dysregulation of genes associated with the ECM and EMT - thus highlighting important molecular crosstalk for further investigations.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The striatum is organized into two major outputs formed by striatal projection neuron (SPN) subtypes with distinct molecular identities. In addition, histochemical division into patch and matrix compartments represents an additional spatial organization, proposed to mirror a motor-motivation regionalization. To map the molecular diversity of patch versus matrix SPNs, we genetically labeled mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) expressing neurons and performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing. This allowed us to establish molecular definitions of patch, matrix, and exopatch SPNs, as well as identification of Col11a1+ striatonigral SPNs. At the tissue level, mapping the expression of candidate markers reveals organization of spatial domains, which are conserved in the non-human primate brain. The spatial markers are cell-type independent and instead represent a spatial code found across all SPNs within a spatial domain. The spatiomolecular map establishes a formal system for targeting and studying striatal subregions and SPNs subtypes, beyond the classical striatonigral and striatopallidal division.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Germline variants in DNA repair genes are associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PrCa). The aim of this study was to characterize germline variants in DNA repair genes associated with lethal PrCa in Finnish and Swedish populations. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 122 lethal and 60 unselected PrCa cases. Among the lethal cases, a total of 16 potentially damaging protein-truncating variants in DNA repair genes were identified in 15 men (12.3%). Mutations were found in six genes with CHEK2 (4.1%) and ATM (3.3%) being most frequently mutated. Overall, the carrier rate of truncating variants in DNA repair genes among men with lethal PrCa significantly exceeded the carrier rate of 0% in 60 unselected PrCa cases (p = 0.030), and the prevalence of 1.6% (p < 0.001) and 5.4% (p = 0.040) in Swedish and Finnish population controls from the Exome Aggregation Consortium. No significant difference in carrier rate of potentially damaging nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants between lethal and unselected PrCa cases was observed (p = 0.123). We confirm that DNA repair genes are strongly associated with lethal PrCa in Sweden and Finland and highlight the importance of population-specific assessment of variants contributing to PrCa aggressiveness.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Organic pollutants (OPs) are critically toxic, bioaccumulative and globally widespread. Moreover, several OPs negatively influence aquatic wildlife. Although bacteria are major drivers of the ocean carbon cycle and the turnover of vital elements, there is limited knowledge of OP effects on heterotrophic bacterioplankton. We therefore investigated growth and gene expression responses of the Baltic Sea model bacterium Rheinheimera sp. BAL341 to environmentally relevant concentrations of distinct classes of OPs in 2-h incubation experiments. During exponential growth, exposure to a mix of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes and organophosphate esters (denoted MIX) resulted in a significant decrease (between 9% and 18%) in bacterial abundance and production compared with controls. In contrast, combined exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acids and perfluorooctanoic acids (denoted PFAS) had no significant effect on growth. Nevertheless, MIX and PFAS exposures both induced significant shifts in gene expression profiles compared with controls in exponential growth. This involved several functional metabolism categories (e.g. stress response and fatty acids metabolism), some of which were pollutant-specific (e.g. phosphate acquisition and alkane-1 monooxygenase genes). In stationary phase, only two genes in the MIX treatment were significantly differentially expressed. The substantial direct influence of OPs on metabolism during bacterial growth suggests that widespread OPs could severely alter biogeochemical processes governed by bacterioplankton.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) is a small rodent distributed across the Fennoscandian mountain tundra and the Kola Peninsula. The Norwegian lemming likely evolved during the Late Pleistocene and inhabited Fennoscandia shortly prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. However, the exact timing and origins of the species, and its phylogenetic position relative to the closely related Siberian lemming (Lemmus sibiricus) remain disputed. Moreover, the presence of ancient or contemporary gene flow between both species is largely untested. The Norwegian lemming displays characteristic phenotypic and behavioral adaptations (e.g., coat color, aggression) that are not present in other Lemmus species. We generated a de novo genome assembly for the Norwegian lemming and resequenced nine modern and two ancient Lemmus spp. genomes. We show that all Lemmus species form distinct monophyletic clades, with concordant topology between the mitochondrial and nuclear genome phylogenies. The Siberian lemming is divided into two distinct but paraphyletic clades, one in the east and one in the west, where the western clade represents a sister taxon to the Norwegian lemming. We estimate that the Norwegian and western Siberian lemming diverged shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum, making the Norwegian lemming one of the youngest known mammalian species. We did not find any indication of gene flow between L. lemmus and L. sibiricus, suggesting postglacial isolation of L. lemmus. Furthermore, we identify species-specific genomic differences in genes related to coat color and fat transport, which are likely associated with the distinctive coloration and overwintering behavior observed in the Norwegian lemming.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The joint expression of particular colors, morphologies, and behaviors is a common feature of adaptation, but the genetic basis for such "phenotypic syndromes" remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a complex genetic architecture associated with a sexually selected syndrome in common wall lizards, by capitalizing on the adaptive introgression of coloration and morphology into a distantly related lineage. Consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of phenotypic syndromes in vertebrates is facilitated by developmental linkage through neural crest cells, most of the genes associated with the syndrome are involved in neural crest cell regulation. A major locus was a ~400-kb region, characterized by standing structural genetic variation and previously implied in the evolutionary innovation of coloration and beak size in birds. We conclude that features of the developmental and genetic architecture contribute to maintaining trait integration, facilitating the extensive and rapid introgressive spread of suites of sexually selected characters.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Is the composition of microRNAs (miRNAs) in uterine fluid (UF) of women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) different from that of healthy fertile women?

The composition of miRNAs in UF of women with RIF is different from that of healthy fertile women and the dysregulated miRNAs are associated with impaired endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation.

It has previously been demonstrated that the miRNAs secreted from endometrial cells into the UF contribute to the achievement of endometrial receptivity. Endometrial miRNAs are dysregulated in women with RIF.

In this descriptive laboratory case-control study, miRNA abundancy was compared between UF collected during implantation phase from healthy fertile women (n = 17) and women with RIF (n = 34), which was defined as three failed IVF cycles with high-quality embryos.

Recruitment of study subjects and sampling of UF were performed at two university clinics in Stockholm, Sweden and Tartu, Estonia. The study participants monitored their menstrual cycles using an LH test kit. The UF samples were collected on Day LH + 7-9 by flushing with saline. Samples were processed for small RNA sequencing and mapped for miRNAs. The differential abundance of miRNAs in UF was compared between the two groups using differential expression analysis (DESeq2). Further downstream analyses, including miRNA target gene prediction (miRTarBase), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (g:Profiler) and external validation using relevant published data, were performed on the dysregulated miRNAs. Two miRNAs were technically validated with quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR).

After processing of the sequencing data, there were 15 samples in the healthy fertile group and 33 samples in the RIF group. We found 61 differentially abundant UF miRNAs (34 upregulated and 27 downregulated) in RIF compared to healthy women with a false discovery rate of <0.05 and a fold change (FC) of ≤-2 or ≥2. When analyzed with published literature, we found that several of the differentially abundant miRNAs are expressed in endometrial epithelial cells and have been reported in endometrial extracellular vesicles and in association with endometrial receptivity and RIF. Their predicted target genes were further expressed both in the trophectodermal cells of blastocyst-stage embryos and endometrial mid-secretory epithelial cells, as assessed by publicly available single-cell transcriptome-sequencing studies. Pathway analysis further revealed that 25 pathways, having key roles in endometrial receptivity and implantation, were significantly enriched. Hsa-miR-486-5p (FC -20.32; P-value = 0.004) and hsa-miR-92b-3p (FC -9.72; P-value = 0.004) were successfully technically validated with RT-PCR.

The data are available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ with GEO accession number: GSE173289.

This is a descriptive study with a limited number of study participants. Moreover, the identified differentially abundant miRNAs should be validated in a larger study cohort, and the predicted miRNA target genes and enriched pathways in RIF need to be confirmed and further explored in vitro.

RIF is a major challenge in the current IVF setting with no diagnostic markers nor effective treatment options at hand. For the first time, total miRNAs have been extensively mapped in receptive phase UF of both healthy women with proven fertility and women diagnosed with RIF. Our observations shed further light on the molecular mechanisms behind RIF, with possible implications in future biomarker and clinical treatment studies.

                    <div class="modal-body small">SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is an important regulator of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in the thermosensory pathway of Arabidopsis. It is a negative regulator of flowering and represses FT transcription. In poplar trees, FT2 is central for the photoperiodic control of growth cessation, which also requires the decrease of bioactive gibberellins (GAs). In angiosperm trees, genes similar to SVP, sometimes named DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX genes, control temperature-mediated bud dormancy. Here we show that SVL, an SVP ortholog in aspen trees, besides its role in controlling dormancy through its expression in buds, is also contributing to the regulation of short day induced growth cessation and bud set through its expression in leaves. SVL is upregulated during short days in leaves and binds to the FT2 promoter to repress its transcription. It furthermore decreases the amount of active GAs, whose downregulation is essential for growth cessation, by repressing the transcription of GA20 oxidase. Finally, the SVL protein is more stable in colder temperatures, thus integrating the temperature signal into the response. We conclude that the molecular function of SVL in the photoperiodic pathway has been conserved between Arabidopsis and poplar trees, albeit the physiological process it controls has changed. SVL is thus both involved in regulating the photoperiod response in leaves, modulating the timing of growth cessation and bud set, and in the subsequent temperature regulation of dormancy in the buds.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Tradeoffs affect resource allocation during development and result in fitness consequences that drive the evolution of life history strategies. Yet despite their importance, we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs. Many species of Colias butterflies exhibit an alternative life history strategy (ALHS) where females divert resources from wing pigment synthesis to reproductive and somatic development. Due to this reallocation, a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS: either yellow/orange or white. Here we map the locus associated with this ALHS in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion located downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1, a homeobox transcription factor. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, antibody staining, and electron microscopy we find white-specific expression of BarH-1 suppresses the formation of pigment granules in wing scales and gives rise to white wing color. Lipid and transcriptome analyses reveal physiological differences associated with the ALHS. Together, these findings characterize a mechanism for a female-limited ALHS.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">A considerable fraction of organic matter derived from photosynthesis in the euphotic zone settles into the ocean's interior and, as it progresses, is degraded by diverse microbial consortia that utilize a suite of extracellular enzymes and membrane transporters. Still, the molecular details that regulate carbon cycling across depths remain little explored. As stratification in fjords has made them attractive models to explore patterns in biological oceanography, we here analyzed bacterial and archaeal transcription in samples from five depth layers in the Gullmar Fjord, Sweden. Transcriptional variation over depth correlated with gradients in chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations. Differences in transcription between sampling dates (summer and early autumn) were strongly correlated with ammonium concentrations, which potentially was linked with a stronger influence of (micro-)zooplankton grazing in summer. Transcriptional investment in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) decreased with depth and shifted toward peptidases, partly a result of elevated CAZyme transcription by Flavobacteriales, Cellvibrionales, and Synechococcales at 2 to 25 m and a dominance of peptidase transcription by Alteromonadales and Rhodobacterales from 50 m down. In particular, CAZymes for chitin, laminarin, and glycogen were important. High levels of transcription of ammonium transporter genes by Thaumarchaeota at depth (up to 18% of total transcription), along with the genes for ammonia oxidation and CO2 fixation, indicated that chemolithoautotrophy contributed to the carbon flux in the fjord. The taxon-specific expression of functional genes for processing of the marine pool of dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients across depths emphasizes the importance of different microbial foraging mechanisms over spatiotemporal scales for shaping biogeochemical cycles. IMPORTANCE It is generally recognized that stratification in the ocean strongly influences both the community composition and the distribution of ecological functions of microbial communities, which in turn are expected to shape the biogeochemical cycling of essential elements over depth. Here, we used metatranscriptomics analysis to infer molecular detail on the distribution of gene systems central to the utilization of organic matter in a stratified marine system. We thereby uncovered that pronounced shifts in the transcription of genes encoding CAZymes, peptidases, and membrane transporters occurred over depth among key prokaryotic orders. This implies that sequential utilization and transformation of organic matter through the water column is a key feature that ultimately influences the efficiency of the biological carbon pump.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans has both an asexual and a sexual mode of reproduction. In Scandinavia, the pathogen is reproducing sexually on a regular basis, whereas clonal lineages dominate in other geographical regions. This study aimed at elucidating events or key genes underlying this difference in sexual behavior. First, the transcriptomes of eight strains, known as either clonal or sexual, were compared during early stages of mating. Principal component analysis (PCA) divided the samples in two clusters A and B and a clear grouping of the mating samples together with the A1 mating type parents was observed. Induction of genes encoding DNA adenine N6-methylation (6mA) methyl-transferases clearly showed a bias toward the cluster A. In contrast, the Avrblb2 effector gene family was highly induced in most of the mating samples and was associated with cluster B in the PCA, similarly to genes coding for acetyl-transferases, which play an important role in RXLR modification prior to secretion. Avrblb2 knock-down strains displayed a reduction in virulence and oospore formation, suggesting a role during the mating process. In conclusion, a number of gene candidates important for the reproductive processes were revealed. The results suggest a possible epigenetic influence and involvement of specific RXLR effectors in mating-related processes.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Circular RNA (circRNA) molecules, generated through non-canonical back-splicing of exon-exon junctions, have recently been implicated in diverse biological functions including transcriptional regulation and modulation of protein interactions. CircRNAs are emerging as a key component of the complex neural transcriptome implicated in brain development. However, the specific expression patterns and functions of circRNAs in human neuronal differentiation have not been explored.

Using total RNA sequencing analysis, we identified expressed circRNAs during the differentiation of human neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells into developing neurons and discovered that many circRNAs originated from host genes associated with synaptic function. Interestingly, when assessing population data, exons giving rise to circRNAs in our dataset had a higher frequency of genetic variants. Additionally, screening for RNA-binding protein sites identified enrichment of Splicing Factor Proline and Glutamine Rich (SFPQ) motifs in increased circRNAs, several of which were reduced by SFPQ knockdown and enriched in SFPQ ribonucleoprotein complexes.

Our study provides an in-depth characterisation of circRNAs in a human neuronal differentiation model and highlights SFPQ as both a regulator and binding partner of circRNAs elevated during neuronal maturation.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The gut microbiome produces metabolites that interact with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a key regulator of immune homoeostasis in the gut1,2. Here we show that oral exposure to graphene oxide (GO) modulates the composition of the gut microbiome in adult zebrafish, with significant differences in wild-type versus ahr2-deficient animals. Furthermore, GO was found to elicit AhR-dependent induction of cyp1a and homing of lck+ cells to the gut in germ-free zebrafish larvae when combined with the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. To obtain further insights into the immune responses to GO, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile cells from whole germ-free embryos as well as cells enriched for lck. These studies provided evidence for the existence of innate lymphoid cell (ILC)-like cells3 in germ-free zebrafish. Moreover, GO endowed with a 'corona' of microbial butyrate triggered the induction of ILC2-like cells with attributes of regulatory cells. Taken together, this study shows that a nanomaterial can influence the crosstalk between the microbiome and immune system in an AhR-dependent manner.</div>

Rheumatoid arthritis synovium has primarily been studied either by immunostaining or by molecular profiling after tissue homogenization. Here, we use Spatial Transcriptomics, where tissue-resident RNA is spatially labeled in situ with barcodes in a transcriptome-wide fashion, to study local tissue interactions at the site of chronic synovial inflammation. We report comprehensive spatial RNA-Seq data coupled to cell type-specific localization patterns at and around organized structures of infiltrating leukocyte cells in the synovium. Combining morphological features and high-throughput spatially resolved transcriptomics may be able to provide higher statistical power and more insights into monitoring disease severity and treatment-specific responses in seropositive and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.</div>

In vertebrates, the canonical view proposes a selection of the surviving neurons through stochastic competition for target-derived neurotrophic signals, implying an equal potential for neurons to compete. Here we show an alternative cell fitness selection of neurons that is defined by a specific neuronal heterogeneity code. Proprioceptive sensory neurons that will undergo cell death and those that will survive exhibit different molecular signatures that are regulated by retinoic acid and transcription factors, and are independent of the target and neurotrophins. These molecular features are genetically encoded, representing two distinct subgroups of neurons with contrasted functional maturation states and survival outcome. Thus, in this model, a heterogeneous code of intrinsic cell fitness in neighboring neurons provides differential competitive advantage resulting in the selection of cells with higher capacity to survive and functionally integrate into neural networks.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The study of the genetic regulation of metabolism in human serum samples can contribute to a better understanding of the intermediate biological steps that lead from polymorphism to disease. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to discover metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) utilizing samples from a study of prostate cancer in Swedish men, consisting of 402 individuals (214 cases and 188 controls) in a discovery set and 489 case-only samples in a replication set. A global nontargeted metabolite profiling approach was utilized resulting in the detection of 6,138 molecular features followed by targeted identification of associated metabolites. Seven replicating loci were identified (PYROXD2, FADS1, PON1, CYP4F2, UGT1A8, ACADL, and LIPC) with associated sequence variants contributing significantly to trait variance for one or more metabolites (P = 10(-13) -10(-91)). Regional mQTL enrichment analyses implicated two loci that included FADS1 and a novel locus near PDGFC. Biological pathway analysis implicated ACADM, ACADS, ACAD8, ACAD10, ACAD11, and ACOXL, reflecting significant enrichment of genes with acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. mQTL SNPs and mQTL-harboring genes were over-represented across GWASs conducted to date, suggesting that these data may have utility in tracing the molecular basis of some complex disease associations.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Single-cell sequencing (sc-seq) provides a species agnostic tool to study cellular processes. However, these technologies are expensive and require sufficient cell quantities and biological replicates to avoid artifactual results. An option to address these problems is pooling cells from multiple individuals into one sc-seq library. In humans, genotype-based computational separation (i.e., demultiplexing) of pooled sc-seq samples is common. This approach would be instrumental for studying non-isogenic model organisms. We set out to determine whether genotype-based demultiplexing could be more broadly applied among species ranging from zebrafish to non-human primates. Using such non-isogenic species, we benchmark genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq datasets against various ground truths. We demonstrate that genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq samples can be used with confidence in several non-isogenic model organisms and uncover limitations of this method. Importantly, the only genomic resource required for this approach is sc-seq data and a de novo transcriptome. The incorporation of pooling into sc-seq study designs will decrease cost while simultaneously increasing the reproducibility and experimental options in non-isogenic model organisms.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The limited tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to inhibitors is a major challenge in second-generation bioethanol production, and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms providing tolerance to inhibitor-rich lignocellulosic hydrolysates is incomplete. Short-term adaptation of the yeast in the presence of dilute hydrolysate can improve its robustness and productivity during subsequent fermentation.

We utilized RNA sequencing to investigate differential gene expression in the industrial yeast strain CR01 during short-term adaptation, mimicking industrial conditions for cell propagation. In this first transcriptomic study of short-term adaption of S. cerevisiae to lignocellulosic hydrolysate, we found that cultures respond by fine-tuned up- and down-regulation of a subset of general stress response genes. Furthermore, time-resolved RNA sequencing allowed for identification of genes that were differentially expressed at 2 or more sampling points, revealing the importance of oxidative stress response, thiamin and biotin biosynthesis. furan-aldehyde reductases and specific drug:H+ antiporters, as well as the down-regulation of certain transporter genes.

These findings provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing short-term adaptation of S. cerevisiae to lignocellulosic hydrolysate, and suggest new genetic targets for improving fermentation robustness.</div>

Deep sequencing of sun-exposed and shielded microdissected skin from mid-life individuals revealed that persistent p53 mutations had accumulated in 14% of all epidermal cells, with no apparent signs of a growth advantage of the affected cell compartments. Furthermore, 6% of the mutated epidermal cells encoded a truncated protein. The abundance of these events, not taking into account intron mutations and mutations in other genes that also may have functional implications, suggests an extensive tolerance of human cells to severe genetic alterations caused by UV light, with an estimated annual rate of accumulation of ∼35,000 new persistent protein-altering p53 mutations in sun-exposed skin of a human individual.</div>

We present a new complete molecular (mtDNA) subspecies level phylogeny of the Oriolidae including all 113 taxa (35 species) together with a backbone phylogeny of 19 taxa from the main Oriolus clades based on (i) 21 nuclear genes, (ii) whole mito-genomes, and (iii) genome-wide ultraconserved elements. We use this phylogeny to assess systematic relationships and the biogeographical history of this avian family. Furthermore, we use morphological measurements to investigate the relationship between size and shape axes and upstream or back-colonization of this extensive island region from Asia. We show that several subspecies or groups of subspecies may warrant species rank and we find a continental example of two morphologically distinct species (O. mellianus/O. traillii) being genetically (mtDNA) very similar. Biogeographically, we confirm previous findings that members of the Oriolidae originated in Australo-Papua. Dispersal out of this area took place around 15 Mya to southeast Asia and Africa, and from Africa to the Palearctic followed by recolonization of the Indonesian and Philippine island region during the Plio-Pleistocene. Recolonisation of the Indonesian and Philippine islands coincided with an increase in body size, which may have facilitated the ability to co-exist with other congenerics.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDKN2A occur in 5-20% of familial melanoma cases. A single founder mutation, p.Arg112dup, accounts for the majority of CDKN2A mutations in Swedish carriers. In a national program, carriers of p.Arg112dup mutation have been identified. The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in p.Arg112dup carriers and their first degree relatives (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRs).

In this prospective cohort study, cancer diagnoses in carriers (n=120), non-carriers (n=111), carriers' FDRs (n=275) and SDRs (n=321) and controls (n=3976) were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Relative risks (RRs) for cancers were calculated (number of cancers/person years). Two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for all RRs.

In carriers prospective RR for non-melanoma cancers was 5.0 (95% CI 3.7 to 7.3), for pancreatic cancer 43.8 (95% CI 13.8 to 139.0), for cancers in upper digestive tissues 17.1 (95% CI 6.3 to 46.5), and in respiratory tissues 15.6 (5.4 to 46.0). In FDRs and SDRs RRs were significantly elevated for cancers in pancreas, respiratory and upper digestive tissues. In ever-smoking carriers compared with never-smoking carriers, the odds ratio (OR) of cancers in pancreas, respiratory or upper digestive tissues was 9.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 44.7).

CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers from melanoma-prone families and their FDRs and SDRs have elevated risk for pancreatic, lung, head and neck and gastro-oesophageal carcinomas. These cancers were mainly seen in ever-smoking carriers. Germline CDKN2A mutations may confer an increased sensitivity to carcinogens in tobacco smoke. CDKN2A mutation carriers should be counselled to abstain from smoking.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Darwinian evolution of tumor cells remains underexplored in childhood cancer. We here reconstruct the evolutionary histories of 56 pediatric primary tumors, including 24 neuroblastomas, 24 Wilms tumors, and 8 rhabdomyosarcomas. Whole-genome copy-number and whole-exome mutational profiling of multiple regions per tumor were performed, followed by clonal deconvolution to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree for each tumor. Overall, 88% of the tumors exhibited genetic variation among primary tumor regions. This variability typically emerged through collateral phylogenetic branching, leading to spatial variability in the distribution of more than 50% (96/173) of detected diagnostically informative genetic aberrations. Single-cell sequencing of 547 individual cancer cells from eight solid pediatric tumors confirmed branching evolution to be a fundamental underlying principle of genetic variation in all cases. Strikingly, cell-to-cell genetic diversity was almost twice as high in aggressive compared with clinically favorable tumors (median Simpson index of diversity 0.45 vs. 0.88; P = 0.029). Similarly, a comparison of multiregional sampling data from a total of 274 tumor regions showed that new phylogenetic branches emerge at a higher frequency per sample and carry a higher mutational load in high-risk than in low-risk tumors. Timelines based on spatial genetic variation showed that the mutations most influencing relapse risk occur at initiation of clonal expansion in neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, whereas in Wilms tumor, they are late events. Thus, from an evolutionary standpoint, some high-risk childhood cancers are born bad, whereas others grow worse over time. SIGNIFICANCE: Different pediatric cancers with a high risk of relapse share a common generic pattern of extensively branching evolution of somatic mutations.

                    <div class="modal-body small">Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney failure, which increases globally and represents a significant threat to public health. People from the Middle East represent one of the largest immigrant groups in Europe today. Despite poor glucose regulation and high risk for early-onset insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes, they have better kidney function and lower rates of all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality compared with people of European ancestry. Here, we assessed the genetic basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other metabolic traits in people of Iraqi ancestry living in southern Sweden.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were performed in 1201 Iraqi-born residents of the city of Malmö for eGFR and ten other metabolic traits using linear mixed-models to account for family structure.

The strongest association signal was detected for eGFR in CST9 (rs13037490; P value = 2.4 × 10-13), a locus previously associated with cystatin C-based eGFR; importantly, the effect (major) allele here contrasts the effect (minor) allele in other populations, suggesting favorable selection at this locus. Additional novel genome-wide significant loci for eGFR (ERBB4), fasting glucose (CAMTA1, NDUFA10, TRIO, WWC1, TRAPPC9, SH3GL2, ABCC11), quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (METTL16), and HbA1C (CAMTA1, ME1, PAK1, RORA) were identified.

The genetic effects discovered here may help explain why people from the Middle East have better kidney function than those of European descent. Genetic predisposition to preserved kidney function may also underlie the observed survival benefits in Middle Eastern immigrants with type 2 diabetes.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Circadian clock is important to living organisms to adjust to the external environment. This clock has been extensively studied in mammals, and prokineticin 2 (Prok2) acts as one of the messenger between the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. In this study, expression profiles of Prok1 and Prok2 were investigated in a non-mammalian vertebrate brain, zebrafish, and the expression was compared to the Prok homologues, astakines (Ast1 and Ast2) in crayfish. These transcripts exhibited circadian oscillation in the brain, and Ast1 had similar pattern to Prok2. In addition, the expression of tyrosinase, an enzyme which expression is regulated by E-box elements like in Prok2, was also examined in zebrafish brain and was compared with the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO), the melanization enzyme, in crayfish brain. Interestingly, the expressions of both Tyr and proPO displayed circadian rhythm in a similar pattern to Prok2 and Ast1, respectively. Therefore, this study shows that circadian oscillation of prokineticin homologues and enzymes involved in melanization are conserved.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Cardiogenic growth factors play important roles in heart development. Placental growth factor (PLGF) has previously been reported to have angiogenic effects; however, its potential role in cardiogenesis has not yet been determined. We analyze single-cell RNA-sequencing data derived from human and primate embryonic hearts and find PLGF shows a biphasic expression pattern, as it is expressed specifically on ISL1+ second heart field progenitors at an earlier stage and on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) at later stages. Using chemically modified mRNAs (modRNAs), we generate a panel of cardiogenic growth factors and test their effects on enhancing cardiomyocyte (CM) and EC induction during different stages of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiations. We discover that only the application of PLGF modRNA at early time points of hESC-CM differentiation can increase both CM and EC production. Conversely, genetic deletion of PLGF reduces generation of CMs, SMCs and ECs in vitro. We also confirm in vivo beneficial effects of PLGF modRNA for development of human heart progenitor-derived cardiac muscle grafts on murine kidney capsules. Further, we identify the previously unrecognized PLGF-related transcriptional networks driven by EOMES and SOX17. These results shed light on the dual cardiomyogenic and vasculogenic effects of PLGF during heart development.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Ewing sarcomas (ESs) are aggressive sarcomas driven by EWS fusion genes. We sought to investigate whether whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) could be used to detect patterns associated with chemotherapy response or tumor progression after first-line treatment. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of 13 ES cases was performed. Among the differentially expressed pathways, we identified IGF2 expression as a potential driver of chemotherapy response and progression. We investigated the effect of IGF2 on proliferation, radioresistance, apoptosis, and the transcriptome pattern in four ES cell lines and the effect of IGF2 expression in a validation series of 14 patients. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes (adj. P < 0.005) and pathways associated with chemotherapy response (285 genes), short overall survival (662 genes), and progression after treatment (447 genes). Imprinting independent promoter P3-mediated IGF2 expression was identified in a subset of cases with aggressive clinical course. In ES cell lines, IGF2 induced proliferation, but promoted radioresistance only in CADO cells. High IGF2 expression was also significantly associated with shorter overall survival in patients with ES. Transcriptome analysis of the clinical samples and the cell lines revealed an IGF-dependent signature, potentially related to a stem cell-like phenotype. Transcriptome analysis is a potentially powerful complementary tool to predict the clinical behavior of ES and may be utilized for clinical trial stratification strategies and personalized oncology. Certain gene signatures, for example, IGF-related pathways, are coupled to biological functions that could be of clinical importance. Finally, our results indicate that IGF inhibition may be successful as a first-line therapy in conjunction with conventional radiochemotherapy for a subset of patients.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH) is a mesenchymal tumor that most often occurs in the skin (so-called dermatofibroma), but may also appear in soft tissues (so-called deep BFH) and in the skeleton (so-called non-ossifying fibroma). The origin of BFH is unknown, and it has been questioned whether it is a true neoplasm. Chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, RNA sequencing, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were used to search for recurrent somatic mutations in a series of BFH. BFHs were found to harbor recurrent fusions of genes encoding membrane-associated proteins (podoplanin, CD63 and LAMTOR1) with genes encoding protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms PRKCB and PRKCD. PKCs are serine-threonine kinases that through their many phosphorylation targets are implicated in a variety of cellular processes, as well as tumor development. When inactive, the amino-terminal, regulatory domain of PKCs suppresses the activity of their catalytic domain. Upon activation, which requires several steps, they typically translocate to cell membranes, where they interact with different signaling pathways. The detected PDPN-PRKCB, CD63-PRKCD and LAMTOR1-PRKCD gene fusions are all predicted to result in chimeric proteins consisting of the membrane-binding part of PDPN, CD63 or LAMTOR1 and the entire catalytic domain of the PKC. This novel pathogenetic mechanism should result in constitutive kinase activity at an ectopic location. The results show that BFH indeed is a true neoplasm, and that distorted PKC activity is essential for tumorigenesis. The findings also provide means to differentiate BFH from other skin and soft tissue tumors. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Rare cancers.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Domesticated animals are unique to investigate the contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to specific phenotypes. Among non-genetic factors involved in phenotype formation are epigenetic mechanisms. Here we aimed to identify whether relative DNA methylation differences in the nidopallium between groups of individuals are among the non-genetic factors involved in the emergence of differential behavioral patterns in hens. The nidopallium was selected due to its important role in complex cognitive function (i.e., decision making) in birds. Behavioral patterns that spontaneously emerge in hens living in a highly controlled environment were identified with a unique tracking system that recorded their transitions between pen zones. Behavioral activity patterns were characterized through three classification schemes: (i) daily specific features of behavioral routines (Entropy), (ii) daily spatio-temporal activity patterns (Dynamic Time Warping), and (iii) social leading behavior (Leading Index). Unique differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between behavioral patterns emerging within classification schemes, with entropy having the higher number. Functionally, DTW had double the proportion of affected promoters and half of the distal intergenic regions. Pathway enrichment analysis of DMR-associated genes revealed that Entropy relates mainly to cell cycle checkpoints, Leading Index to mitochondrial function, and DTW to gene expression regulation. Our study suggests that different biological functions within neurons (particularly in the nidopallium) could be responsible for the emergence of distinct behavior patterns and that epigenetic variation within brain tissues would be an important factor to explain behavioral variation.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons comprise diverse cells with unique innervation targets and functions. This is illustrated by the selective sensitivity of mDA neurons of the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) in patients with Parkinson's disease, while those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are relatively spared. Here, we used single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of approximately 70,000 mouse midbrain cells to build a high-resolution atlas of mouse mDA neuron diversity at the molecular level. The results showed that differences between mDA neuron groups could best be understood as a continuum without sharp differences between subtypes. Thus, we assigned mDA neurons to several 'territories' and 'neighborhoods' within a shifting gene expression landscape where boundaries are gradual rather than discrete. Based on the enriched gene expression patterns of these territories and neighborhoods, we were able to localize them in the adult mouse midbrain. Moreover, because the underlying mechanisms for the variable sensitivities of diverse mDA neurons to pathological insults are not well understood, we analyzed surviving neurons after partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions to unravel gene expression patterns that correlate with mDA neuron vulnerability and resilience. Together, this atlas provides a basis for further studies on the neurophysiological role of mDA neurons in health and disease.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well established model organism for studying numerous aspects of cellular and developmental functions. Its ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is encoded in an extrachromosomal palindrome that exists in ∼100 copies in the cell. In this study, we have set out to investigate the sequence of the expressed rRNA. For this, we have ligated the rRNA ends and performed RT-PCR on these circular RNAs. Sequencing revealed that the mature 26 S, 17 S, 5.8 S, and 5 S rRNAs have sizes of 3741, 1871, 162, and 112 nucleotides, respectively. Unlike the published data, all mature rRNAs of the same type uniformly display the same start and end nucleotides in the analyzed AX2 strain. We show the existence of a short lived primary transcript covering the rRNA transcription unit of 17 S, 5.8 S, and 26 S rRNA. Northern blots and RT-PCR reveal that from this primary transcript two precursor molecules of the 17 S and two precursors of the 26 S rRNA are generated. We have also determined the sequences of these precursor molecules, and based on these data, we propose a model for the maturation of the rRNAs in Dictyostelium discoideum that we compare with the processing of the rRNA transcription unit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue cancer that arises in skeletal muscle due to mutations in myogenic progenitors that lead to ineffective differentiation and malignant transformation. The transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7 and their downstream target genes are tightly linked with the fusion positive alveolar subtype, whereas the RAS pathway is usually involved in the embryonal, fusion negative variant. Here, we analyse the role of Pax3 in a fusion negative context, by linking alterations in gene expression in pax3a/pax3b double mutant zebrafish with tumour progression in kRAS-induced rhabdomyosarcoma tumours. Several genes in the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway were significantly down-regulated in pax3a/pax3b double mutant zebrafish. Progression of rhabdomyosarcoma tumours was also delayed in the pax3a/pax3b double mutant zebrafish indicating that Pax3 transcription factors have an unappreciated role in mediating malignancy in fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">It is generally recognized that large-scale whaling in the 19th and 20th century led to a substantial reduction of the size of many cetacean populations, particularly those of the baleen whales (Mysticeti). The impact of these operations on genomic diversity of one of the most hunted whales, the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), has remained largely unaddressed because of the paucity of adequate samples and the limitation of applicable techniques. Here, we have examined the effect of whaling on the North Atlantic fin whale based on genomes of 51 individuals from Icelandic waters, representing three temporally separated intervals, 1989, 2009 and 2018 and provide a reference genome for the species. Demographic models suggest a noticeable drop of the effective population size of the North Atlantic fin whale around a century ago. The present results suggest that the genome-wide heterozygosity is not markedly reduced and has remained comparable with other baleen whale species. Similarly, there are no signs of apparent inbreeding, as measured by the proportion of long runs of homozygosity, or of a distinctively increased mutational load, as measured by the amount of putative deleterious mutations. Compared with other baleen whales, the North Atlantic fin whale appears to be less affected by anthropogenic influences than other whales such as the North Atlantic right whale, consistent with the presence of long runs of homozygosity and higher levels of mutational load in an otherwise more heterozygous genome. Thus, genome-wide assessments of other species and populations are essential for future, more specific, conservation efforts.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The genomes of immortalized cell lines (and cancer cells) are characterized by multiple types of aberrations, ranging from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to structural rearrangements that have accumulated over time. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the relative impact of different aberrations, the order of events, and which gene functions were under selective pressure at the early stage towards cellular immortalization. Here, we have established novel cell cultures derived from Drosophila melanogaster embryos that were sampled at multiple time points over a one-year period. Using short-read DNA sequencing, we show that copy-number gain in preferentially stress-related genes were acquired in a dominant fraction of cells in 300-days old cultures. Furthermore, transposable elements were active in cells of all cultures. Only a few (<1%) SNPs could be followed over time, and these showed no trend to increase or decrease. We conclude that the early cellular responses of a novel culture comprise sequence duplication and transposable element activity. During immortalization, positive selection first occurs on genes that are related to stress response before shifting to genes that are related to growth.</div>

To expand our basic understanding of the neurobiology of the brain and its diseases, we performed a comprehensive molecular dissection of 10 major brain regions and multiple subregions using a variety of transcriptomics methods and antibody-based mapping. This analysis was carried out in the human, pig, and mouse brain to allow the identification of regional expression profiles, as well as to study similarities and differences in expression levels between the three species. The resulting data have been made available in an open-access Brain Atlas resource, part of the Human Protein Atlas, to allow exploration and comparison of the expression of individual protein-coding genes in various parts of the mammalian brain.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Increasing our understanding of how evolutionary processes drive the genomic landscape of variation is fundamental to a better understanding of the genomic consequences of speciation. However, genome-wide patterns of within- and between- species variation have not been fully investigated in most forest tree species despite their global ecological and economic importance. Here, we use whole-genome resequencing data from four Populus species spanning the speciation continuum to reconstruct their demographic histories and investigate patterns of diversity and divergence within and between species. Using Populus trichocarpa as an outgroup species, we further infer the genealogical relationships and estimate the extent of ancient introgression among the three aspen species (Populus tremula, Populus davidiana and Populus tremuloides) throughout the genome. Our results show substantial variation in these patterns along the genomes with this variation being strongly predicted by local recombination rates and the density of functional elements. This implies that the interaction between recurrent selection and intrinsic genomic features has dramatically sculpted the genomic landscape over long periods of time. In addition, our findings provide evidence that, apart from background selection, recent positive selection and long-term balancing selection have also been crucial components in shaping patterns of genome-wide variation during the speciation process.</div>
