                    <div class="modal-body small">Transposable elements are ubiquitous residents in eukaryotic genomes. Often considered to be genomic parasites, they can lead to dramatic changes in genome organization, gene expression, and gene evolution. The oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans has evolved a genome organization where core biology genes are predominantly located in genome regions that have relatively few resident transposons. In contrast, disease effector-encoding genes are most frequently located in rapidly evolving genomic regions that are rich in transposons. P. infestans, as a eukaryote, likely uses RNA silencing to minimize the activity of transposons. We have shown that fusion of a short interspersed element (SINE) to an effector gene in P. infestans leads to the silencing of both the introduced fusion and endogenous homologous sequences. This is also likely to occur naturally in the genome of P. infestans, as transcriptional inactivation of effectors is known to occur, and over half of the translocated "RXLR class" of effectors are located within 2 kb of transposon sequences in the P. infestans genome. In this commentary, we review the diverse transposon inventory of P. infestans, its control by RNA silencing, and consequences for expression modulation of nearby effector genes in this economically important plant pathogen.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (Pâ<â5âÃâ10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and Î³-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Climate change has increased the risk for infection of crops with insect-transmitted viruses. Mild autumns provide prolonged active periods to insects, which may spread viruses to winter crops. In autumn 2018, green peach aphids (Myzus persicae) were found in suction traps in southern Sweden that presented infection risk for winter oilseed rape (OSR; Brassica napus) with turnip yellows virus (TuYV). A survey was carried out in spring 2019 with random leaf samples from 46 OSR fields in southern and central Sweden using DAS-ELISA, and TuYV was detected in all fields except one. In the counties of SkÃ¥ne, Kalmar, and ÃstergÃ¶tland, the average incidence of TuYV-infected plants was 75%, and the incidence reached 100% for nine fields. Sequence analyses of the coat protein gene revealed a close relationship between TuYV isolates from Sweden and other parts of the world. High-throughput sequencing for one of the OSR samples confirmed the presence of TuYV and revealed coinfection with TuYV-associated RNA. Molecular analyses of seven sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) plants with yellowing, collected in 2019, revealed that two of them were infected by TuYV, together with two other poleroviruses: beet mild yellowing virus and beet chlorosis virus. The presence of TuYV in sugar beet suggests a spillover from other hosts. Poleroviruses are prone to recombination, and mixed infection with three poleroviruses in the same plant poses a risk for the emergence of new polerovirus genotypes.

                    <div class="modal-body small">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an established risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders and dementias. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may alter the expression of genes without altering the DNA sequence in response to environmental factors. We hypothesized that DNA methylation changes may occur in the injured human brain and be implicated in the neurodegenerative aftermath of TBI. The DNA methylation status of genes related to neurodegeneration; for example, amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), neurofilament heavy (NEFH), neurofilament medium (NEFM), and neurofilament light (NEFL), was analyzed in fresh, surgically resected human brain tissue from 17 severe TBI patients and compared with brain biopsy samples from 19 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). We also performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) comparing TBI patients with iNPH controls. Thirty-eight CpG sites in the APP, MAPT, NEFH, and NEFL genes were differentially methylated by TBI. Among the top 20 differentially methylated CpG sites, 11 were in the APP gene. In addition, the EWAS evaluating 828,888 CpG sites revealed 308 differentially methylated CpG sites in genes related to cellular/anatomical structure development, cell differentiation, and anatomical morphogenesis. These preliminary findings provide the first evidence of an altered DNA methylome in the injured human brain, and may have implications for the neurodegenerative disorders associated with TBI.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The wels catfish (Silurus glanis) is one of the largest freshwater fish species in the world. This top predator plays a key role in ecosystem stability, and represents an iconic trophy-fish for recreational fishermen. S. glanis is also a highly valued species for its high-quality boneless flesh, and has been cultivated for over 100 years in Eastern and Central Europe. The interest in rearing S. glanis continues to grow; the aquaculture production of this species has almost doubled during the last decade. However, despite its high ecological, cultural and economic importance, the available genomic resources for S. glanis are very limited. To fulfill this gap we report a de novo assembly and annotation of the whole genome sequence of a female S. glanis The linked-read based technology with 10X Genomics Chromium chemistry and Supernova assembler produced a highly continuous draft genome of S. glanis: â¼0.8Gb assembly (scaffold N 50 = 3.2 Mb; longest individual scaffold = 13.9 Mb; BUSCO completeness = 84.2%), which included 313.3 Mb of putative repeated sequences. In total, 21,316 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 96% were annotated functionally from either sequence homology or protein signature searches. The highly continuous genome assembly will be an invaluable resource for aquaculture genomics, genetics, conservation, and breeding research of S. glanis.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Understanding the drivers of speciation is fundamental in evolutionary biology, and recent studies highlight hybridization as an important evolutionary force. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 22 species of guenons (tribe Cercopithecini), one of the world's largest primate radiations, we show that rampant gene flow characterizes their evolutionary history and identify ancient hybridization across deeply divergent lineages that differ in ecology, morphology, and karyotypes. Some hybridization events resulted in mitochondrial introgression between distant lineages, likely facilitated by cointrogression of coadapted nuclear variants. Although the genomic landscapes of introgression were largely lineage specific, we found that genes with immune functions were overrepresented in introgressing regions, in line with adaptive introgression, whereas genes involved in pigmentation and morphology may contribute to reproductive isolation. In line with reports from other systems that hybridization might facilitate diversification, we find that some of the most species-rich guenon clades are of admixed origin. This study provides important insights into the prevalence, role, and outcomes of ancestral hybridization in a large mammalian radiation.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Several indigenous cattle breeds in Sweden are endangered. Conservation of their genetic diversity and genomic characterization is a priority.Whole-genome sequences (WGS) with a mean coverage of 25X, ranging from 14 to 41X were obtained for 30 individuals of the breeds FjÃ¤llko, FjÃ¤llnÃ¤ra, Bohuskulla, RÃ¶dkulla, RingamÃ¥la, and VÃ¤neko. WGS-based genotyping revealed 22,548,028 variants in total, comprising 18,876,115 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3,671,913 indels. Out of these, 1,154,779 SNPs and 304,467 indels were novel. Population stratification based on roughly 19 million SNPs showed two major groups of the breeds that correspond to northern and southern breeds. Overall, a higher genetic diversity was observed in the southern breeds compared to the northern breeds. While the population stratification was consistent with previous genome-wide SNP array-based analyses, the genealogy of the individuals inferred from WGS based estimates turned out to be more complex than expected from previous SNP-array based estimates. Polymorphisms and their predicted phenotypic consequences were associated with differences in the coat color phenotypes between the northern and southern breeds. Notably, these high-consequence polymorphisms were not represented in SNP arrays, which are used routinely for genotyping of cattle breeds.This study is the first WGS-based population genetic analysis of Swedish native cattle breeds. The genetic diversity of native breeds was found to be high. High-consequence polymorphisms were linked with desirable phenotypes using whole-genome genotyping, which highlights the pressing need for intensifying WGS-based characterization of the native breeds.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Changes in the location of Î³-tubulin ensure cell survival and preserve genome integrity. We investigated whether the nuclear accumulation of Î³-tubulin facilitates the transport of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) between the cytosolic and the nuclear compartment in mammalian cells. We found that the Î³-tubulin meshwork assists in the recruitment of PCNA to chromatin. Also, decreased levels of Î³-tubulin reduce the nuclear pool of PCNA. In addition, the Î³-tubulin C terminus encodes a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motif, and a Î³-tubulin-PIP-mutant affects the nuclear accumulation of PCNA. In a cell-free system, PCNA and Î³-tubulin formed a complex. In tumors, there is a significant positive correlation between TUBG1 and PCNA expression. Thus, we report a novel mechanism that constitutes the basis for tumor growth by which the Î³-tubulin meshwork maintains indefinite proliferation by acting as an opportune scaffold for the transport of PCNA from the cytosol to the chromatin.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Acetogens play a key role in anaerobic degradation of organic material and in maintaining biogas process efficiency. Profiling this community and its temporal changes can help evaluate process stability and function, especially under disturbance/stress conditions, and avoid complete process failure. The formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene can be used as a marker for acetogenic community profiling in diverse environments. In this study, we developed a new high-throughput FTHFS gene sequencing method for acetogenic community profiling and compared it with conventional terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the FTHFS gene, 16S rRNA gene-based profiling of the whole bacterial community, and indirect analysis via 16S rRNA profiling of the FTHFS gene-harbouring community. Analyses and method comparisons were made using samples from two laboratory-scale biogas processes, one operated under stable control and one exposed to controlled overloading disturbance. Comparative analysis revealed satisfactory detection of the bacterial community and its changes for all methods, but with some differences in resolution and taxonomic identification. FTHFS gene sequencing was found to be the most suitable and reliable method to study acetogenic communities. These results pave the way for community profiling in various biogas processes and in other environments where the dynamics of acetogenic bacteria have not been well studied.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Eating disorders and substance use disorders frequently co-occur. Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [rg ], twin-based = 0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge eating, AN without binge eating, and a bulimia nervosa factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Total study sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2400 to ~537 000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN (rg = 0.18; false discovery rate q = 0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (rg = 0.23; q < 0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge eating (rg = 0.27; q = 0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were observed between three nondiagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, current smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge eating (rgs = -0.19 to -0.23; qs < 0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was no longer significant after co-varying for major depressive disorder loci. The patterns of association between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes highlights the potentially complex and substance-specific relationships among these behaviors.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV) is a neurotropic virus associated with congenital tremor type A-II. A few experimental studies also indicate an association between APPV and splay leg. The overarching aim of the present study was to provide insights into the virome, local cytokine response, and histology of the CNS in piglets with signs of congenital tremor or splay leg.

Characterization of the cytokine profile and virome of the brain in piglets with signs of congenital tremor revealed an APPV-associated upregulation of Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The upregulation of STING was associated with an increased expression of the gene encoding IFN-Î± but no differential expression was recorded for the genes encoding CXCL8, IFN-Î², IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-6, or IL-10. No viral agents or cytokine upregulation could be detected in the spinal cord of piglets with signs of splay leg or in the brain of piglets without an APPV-infection. The histopathological examination showed no lesions in the CNS that could be attributed to the APPV-infection, as no difference between sick and healthy piglets could be seen.

The results from this study provide evidence of an APPV-induced antiviral cytokine response but found no lesions related to the infection nor any support for a common causative agent.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The endosperm is a nutritive tissue supporting embryo growth in flowering plants. Most commonly, the endosperm initially develops as a coenocyte (multinucleate cell) and then cellularizes. This process of cellularization is frequently disrupted in hybrid seeds generated by crosses between different flowering plant species or plants that differ in ploidy, resulting in embryo arrest and seed lethality. The reason for embryo arrest upon cellularization failure remains unclear. In this study, we show that triploid Arabidopsis thaliana embryos surrounded by uncellularized endosperm mount an osmotic stress response that is connected to increased levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and enhanced ABA responses. Impairing ABA biosynthesis and signaling aggravated triploid seed abortion, while increasing endogenous ABA levels as well as the exogenous application of ABA-induced endosperm cellularization and suppressed embryo growth arrest. Taking these results together, we propose that endosperm cellularization is required to establish dehydration tolerance in the developing embryo, ensuring its survival during seed maturation.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">To assess the effects of occupational inhalable exposures on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development and their interactions with smoking and RA-risk genes, stratifying by presence of anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA).

Data came from the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of RA, consisting of 4033 incident RA cases and 6485 matched controls. Occupational histories were retrieved, combining with a Swedish national job-exposure matrix, to estimate exposure to 32 inhalable agents. Genetic data were used to define Genetic Risk Score (GRS) or carrying any copy of human leucocyte antigen class II shared epitope (HLA-SE) alleles. Associations were identified with unconditional logistical regression models. Attributable proportion due to interaction was estimated to evaluate presence of interaction.

Exposure to any occupational inhalable agents was associated with increased risk for ACPA-positive RA (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.38). The risk increased as number of exposed agents increased (Ptrend<0.001) or duration of exposure elongated (Ptrend<0.001). When jointly considering exposure to any occupational inhalable agents, smoking and high GRS, a markedly elevated risk for ACPA-positive RA was observed among the triple-exposed group compared with those not exposed to any (OR 18.22, 95% CI 11.77 to 28.19). Significant interactions were found between occupational inhalable agents and smoking/genetic factors (high GRS or HLA-SE) in ACPA-positive RA.

Occupational inhalable agents could act as important environmental triggers in RA development and interact with smoking and RA-risk genes leading to excessive risk for ACPA-positive RA. Future studies are warranted to assess preventive strategies aimed at reducing occupational hazards and smoking, especially among those who are genetically vulnerable.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">This study explores potential associations between the methylation of promoter-associated CpG sites of the toll-like receptor (TLR)-family, plasma levels of pro-inflammatory proteins and depressive symptoms in young female psychiatric patients. Ratings of depressive symptoms and blood samples were obtained from 92 young women seeking psychiatric care. Methylation of 32 promoter-associated CpG sites in TLR1 to TLR10 was analysed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Expression levels of 91 inflammatory proteins were determined by proximity extension assay. Statistical correlations between depressive state, TLR1-10 methylation and inflammatory proteins were investigated. Four additional cohorts were studied to evaluate the generalizability of the findings. In the discovery cohort, methylation grade of cg05429895 (TLR4) in blood was inversely correlated with depressive symptoms score in young adults. After correction for multiple testing, plasma levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1Î² (MIP-1Î²/CCL4) were associated with both TLR4 methylation and depressive symptom severity. A similar inverse association between TLR4 methylation in blood and affective symptoms score was also found in a cohort of 148 both males and females (<40 years of age) from the Danish Twin Registry. These findings were not, however, replicated in three other external cohorts; which differed from the first two cohorts by a higher age and mixed ethnicities, thus limiting the generalizability of our findings. However, TLR4 methylation inversely correlated with TLR4 mRNA expression in the Danish Twin Study indicating a functional significance of methylation at this particular CpG. Higher depression scores in young Scandinavian adults was associated with decreased methylation of TLR4 in blood.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Udder cleft dermatitis (UCD) is a skin condition affecting the fore udder attachment of dairy cows. UCD may be defined as mild (eczematous skin changes) or severe (open wounds, large skin changes). Our aims were to compare the microbiota of mild and severe UCD lesions with the microbiota of healthy skin from the fore udder attachment of control cows, and to investigate whether mastitis-causing pathogens are present in UCD lesions. Samples were obtained from cows in six dairy herds. In total, 36 UCD samples categorized as mild (n = 17) or severe (n = 19) and 13 control samples were sequenced using a shotgun metagenomic approach and the reads were taxonomically classified based on their k-mer content. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the abundance of different taxa between different sample types, as well as to compare the bacterial diversity between samples. A high proportion of bacteria was seen in all samples. Control samples had a higher proportion of archaeal reads, whereas most samples had low proportions of fungi, protozoa and viruses. The bacterial microbiota differed between controls and mild and severe UCD samples in both composition and diversity. Subgroups of UCD samples were visible, characterized by increased proportion of one or a few bacterial genera or species, e.g. Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Brevibacterium luteolum, Trueperella pyogenes and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Bifidobacterium spp. were more common in controls compared to UCD samples. The bacterial diversity was higher in controls compared to UCD samples. Bacteria commonly associated with mastitis were uncommon. In conclusion, a dysbiosis of the microbiota of mild and severe UCD samples was seen, characterized by decreased diversity and an increased proportion of certain bacteria. There was no evidence of a specific pathogen causing UCD or that UCD lesions are important reservoirs for mastitis-causing bacteria.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Microbe-mediated precipitation of Mn-oxides enriched in rare earth elements (REE) and other trace elements was discovered in tunnels leading to the main shaft of the Ytterby mine, Sweden. Defining the spatial distribution of microorganisms and elements in this ecosystem provide a better understanding of specific niches and parameters driving the emergence of these communities and associated mineral precipitates. Along with elemental analyses, high-throughput sequencing of the following four subsystems were conducted: (i) water seeping from a rock fracture into the tunnel, (ii) Mn-oxides and associated biofilm; referred to as the Ytterby Black Substance (YBS) biofilm (iii) biofilm forming bubbles on the Mn-oxides; referred to as the bubble biofilm and (iv) fracture water that has passed through the biofilms. Each subsystem hosts a specific collection of microorganisms. Differentially abundant bacteria in the YBS biofilm were identified within the Rhizobiales (e.g. Pedomicrobium), PLTA13 Gammaproteobacteria, Pirellulaceae, Hyphomonadaceae, Blastocatellia and Nitrospira. These taxa, likely driving the Mn-oxide production, were not detected in the fracture water. This biofilm binds Mn, REE and other trace elements in an efficient, dynamic process, as indicated by substantial depletion of these metals from the fracture water as it passes through the Mn deposit zone. Microbe-mediated oxidation of Mn(II) and formation of Mn(III/IV)-oxides can thus have considerable local environmental impact by removing metals from aquatic environments.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">A compelling body of evidence implicates cigarette smoking and lung inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) susceptibility and progression. Previous studies have reported epigenetic age (DNAm age) acceleration in blood immune cells and in glial cells of people with MS (pwMS) compared to healthy controls (HC).

We aimed to examine biological ageing in lung immune cells in the context of MS and smoking.

We analyzed age acceleration residuals in lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, constituted of mainly alveolar macrophages, from 17 pwMS and 22 HC in relation to smoking using eight DNA methylation-based clocks, namely AltumAge, Horvath, GrimAge, PhenoAge, Zhang, SkinBlood, Hannum, Monocyte clock as well as two RNA-based clocks, which capture different aspects of biological ageing.

After adjustment for covariates, five epigenetic clocks showed significant differences between the groups. Four of them, Horvath (Padj = 0.028), GrimAge (Padj = 4.28 Ã 10-7), SkinBlood (Padj = 0.001) and Zhang (Padj = 0.02), uncovered the sole effect of smoking on ageing estimates, irrespective of the clinical group. The Horvath, SkinBlood and Zhang clocks showed a negative impact of smoking while GrimAge detected smoking-associated age acceleration in BAL cells. On the contrary, the AltumAge clock revealed differences between pwMS and HC and indicated that, in the absence of smoking, BAL cells of pwMS were epigenetically 5.4 years older compared to HC (Padj = 0.028). Smoking further affected epigenetic ageing in BAL cells of pwMS specifically as non-smoking pwMS exhibited a 10.2-year AltumAge acceleration compared to pwMS smokers (Padj = 0.0049). Of note, blood-derived monocytes did not show any MS-specific or smoking-related AltumAge differences. The difference between BAL cells of pwMS smokers and non-smokers was attributable to the differential methylation of 114 AltumAge-CpGs (Padj < 0.05) affecting genes involved in innate immune processes such as cytokine production, defense response and cell motility. These changes functionally translated into transcriptional differences in BAL cells between pwMS smokers and non-smokers.

BAL cells of pwMS display inflammation-related and smoking-dependent changes associated to epigenetic ageing captured by the AltumAge clock. Future studies examining potential confounders, such as the distribution of distinct BAL myeloid cell types in pwMS compared to control individuals in relation to smoking may clarify the varying performance and DNAm age estimations among epigenetic clocks.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Angioedema in the mouth or upper airways is a feared adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatment, which is used for hypertension, heart failure and diabetes complications. This candidate gene and genome-wide association study aimed to identify genetic variants predisposing to angioedema induced by these drugs. The discovery cohort consisted of 173 cases and 4890 controls recruited in Sweden. In the candidate gene analysis, ETV6, BDKRB2, MME, and PRKCQ were nominally associated with angioedema (p < 0.05), but did not pass Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p < 2.89 Ã 10-5). In the genome-wide analysis, intronic variants in the calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1 (KCNMA1) gene on chromosome 10 were significantly associated with angioedema (p < 5 Ã 10-8). Whilst the top KCNMA1 hit was not significant in the replication cohort (413 cases and 599 ACEi-exposed controls from the US and Northern Europe), a meta-analysis of the replication and discovery cohorts (in total 586 cases and 1944 ACEi-exposed controls) revealed that each variant allele increased the odds of experiencing angioedema 1.62 times (95% confidence interval 1.05-2.50, p = 0.030). Associated KCNMA1 variants are not known to be functional, but are in linkage disequilibrium with variants in transcription factor binding sites active in relevant tissues. In summary, our data suggest that common variation in KCNMA1 is associated with risk of angioedema induced by ACEi or ARB treatment. Future whole exome or genome sequencing studies will show whether rare variants in KCNMA1 or other genes contribute to the risk of ACEi- and ARB-induced angioedema.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The stress hormone cortisol modulates fuel metabolism, cardiovascular homoeostasis, mood, inflammation and cognition. The CORtisol NETwork (CORNET) consortium previously identified a single locus associated with morning plasma cortisol. Identifying additional genetic variants that explain more of the variance in cortisol could provide new insights into cortisol biology and provide statistical power to test the causative role of cortisol in common diseases. The CORNET consortium extended its genome-wide association meta-analysis for morning plasma cortisol from 12,597 to 25,314 subjects and from ~2.2 M to ~7 M SNPs, in 17 population-based cohorts of European ancestries. We confirmed the genetic association with SERPINA6/SERPINA1. This locus contains genes encoding corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and Î±1-antitrypsin. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses undertaken in the STARNET cohort of 600 individuals showed that specific genetic variants within the SERPINA6/SERPINA1 locus influence expression of SERPINA6 rather than SERPINA1 in the liver. Moreover, trans-eQTL analysis demonstrated effects on adipose tissue gene expression, suggesting that variations in CBG levels have an effect on delivery of cortisol to peripheral tissues. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses provided evidence that each genetically-determined standard deviation (SD) increase in morning plasma cortisol was associated with increased odds of chronic ischaemic heart disease (0.32, 95% CI 0.06-0.59) and myocardial infarction (0.21, 95% CI 0.00-0.43) in UK Biobank and similarly in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D. These findings reveal a causative pathway for CBG in determining cortisol action in peripheral tissues and thereby contributing to the aetiology of cardiovascular disease.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">It is known that certain cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are associated, like atrial fibrillation and stroke. However, for other CVDs, the links and temporal trends are less studied. In this longitudinal study, we have investigated temporal epidemiological and genetic associations between different CVDs.

The ULSAM (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men; 2322 men aged 50 years) has been followed for 40 years regarding 4 major CVDs (incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation). For the genetic analyses, publicly available data were used.

Using multistate modeling, significant relationships were seen between pairs of all of the 4 investigated CVDs. However, the risk of obtaining one additional CVD differed substantially both between different CVDs and between their temporal order. The relationship between heart failure and atrial fibrillation showed a high risk ratio (risk ratios, 24-26) regardless of the temporal order. A consistent association was seen also for myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation but with a lower relative risk (risk ratios, 4-5). In contrast, the risk of receiving a diagnosis of heart failure following a myocardial infarction was almost twice as high as for the reverse temporal order (risk ratios, 16 versus 9). Genetic loci linked to traditional risk factors could partly explain the observed associations between the CVDs, but pathway analyses disclosed also other pathophysiological links.

During 40 years, all of the 4 investigated CVDs were pairwise associated with each other regardless of the temporal order of occurrence, but the risk magnitude differed between different CVDs and their temporal order. Genetic analyses disclosed new pathophysiological links between CVDs.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Hybridization and admixture can threaten the genetic integrity of populations and be of particular concern to endangered species. Hybridization between grey wolves and dogs has been documented in many wolf populations worldwide and is a prominent example of human-mediated hybridization between a domesticated species and its wild relative. We analysed whole-genome sequences from >200 wolves and >100 dogs to study admixture in Fennoscandian wolf populations. A principal component analysis of genetic variation and admixture showed that wolves and dogs were well-separated, without evidence for introgression. Analyses of local ancestry revealed that wolves had <1% mixed ancestry, levels comparable to the degree of mixed ancestry in many dogs, and likely not resulting from recent wolf-dog hybridization. We also show that the founders of the Scandinavian wolf population were genetically inseparable from Finnish and Russian Karelian wolves, pointing at the geographical origin of contemporary Scandinavian wolves. Moreover, we found Scandinavian-born animals among wolves sampled in Finland, demonstrating bidirectional gene flow between the Scandinavian Peninsula and eastern countries. The low incidence of admixture between wolves and dogs in Fennoscandia may be explained by the fact that feral dogs are rare in this part of Europe and that careful monitoring and management act to remove hybrids before they backcross into wolf populations.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Biological features of neoplastic disease affecting mammary gland tissue are shared between canines and humans. Research performed in either species has translational value and early phase clinical trials performed in canines with spontaneous disease could be informative for human trials. The purpose of this study was to investigate the somatic genetic aberrations occurring in canine mammary neoplasia by exome capture and next generation sequencing. Based on 55 tumor-normal pairs we identified the PIK3CA gene as the most commonly mutated gene in canine mammary tumors, with 25% of samples carrying mutations in this gene. A recurrent missense mutation was identified, p.H1047R, which is homologous to the human PIK3CA hotspot mutation found in different types of breast neoplasia. Mutations homologous to other known human mutation hotspots such as the PIK3CA p.E545K and the KRAS p.G12V/D were also identified. We identified copy number aberrations affecting important tumor suppressor and oncogenic pathways including deletions affecting the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. We suggest that activation of the KRAS or PIK3CA oncogenes or loss of the PTEN suppressor gene may be important for mammary tumor development in dogs. This data endorses the conservation of cancer across species and the validity of studying cancer in non-human species.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Hyperactivation of Notch signaling and the cellular hypoxic response are frequently observed in cancers, with increasing reports of connections to tumor initiation and progression. The two signaling mechanisms are known to intersect, but while it is well established that hypoxia regulates Notch signaling, less is known about whether Notch can regulate the cellular hypoxic response. We now report that Notch signaling specifically controls expression of HIF2Î±, a key mediator of the cellular hypoxic response. Transcriptional upregulation of HIF2Î± by Notch under normoxic conditions leads to elevated HIF2Î± protein levels in primary breast cancer cells as well as in human breast cancer, medulloblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma cell lines. The elevated level of HIF2Î± protein was in certain tumor cell types accompanied by downregulation of HIF1Î± protein levels, indicating that high Notch signaling may drive a HIF1Î±-to-HIF2Î± switch. At the transcriptome level, the presence of HIF2Î± was required for approximately 21% of all Notch-induced genes: among the 1062 genes that were upregulated by Notch in medulloblastoma cells during normoxia, upregulation was abrogated in 227 genes when HIF2Î± expression was knocked down by HIF2Î± siRNA. In conclusion, our data show that Notch signaling affects the hypoxic response via regulation of HIF2Î±, which may be important for future cancer therapies.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The phytohormone ethylene impacts secondary stem growth in plants by stimulating cambial activity, xylem development and fiber over vessel formation. We report the effect of ethylene on secondary cell wall formation and the molecular connection between ethylene signaling and wood formation. We applied exogenous ethylene or its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to wild-type and ethylene-insensitive hybrid aspen trees (Populus tremula Ã tremuloides) and studied secondary cell wall anatomy, chemistry and ultrastructure. We furthermore analyzed the transcriptome (RNA Seq) after ACC application to wild-type and ethylene-insensitive trees. We demonstrate that ACC and ethylene induce gelatinous layers (G-layers) and alter the fiber cell wall cellulose microfibril angle. G-layers are tertiary wall layers rich in cellulose, typically found in tension wood of aspen trees. A vast majority of transcripts affected by ACC are downstream of ethylene perception and include a large number of transcription factors (TFs). Motif-analyses reveal potential connections between ethylene TFs (Ethylene Response Factors (ERFs), ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (EIN3/EIL1)) and wood formation. G-layer formation upon ethylene application suggests that the increase in ethylene biosynthesis observed during tension wood formation is important for its formation. Ethylene-regulated TFs of the ERF and EIN3/EIL1 type could transmit the ethylene signal.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Heart failure affects 2-3% of adult Western population. Prevalence of heart failure with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF) increases. Studies suggest HFpEF patients to have altered myocardial structure and functional changes such as incomplete relaxation and increased cardiac stiffness. We hypothesised that patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery (CABG) with HFpEF characteristics would show distinctive gene expression compared to patients with normal LV physiology. Myocardial biopsies for mRNA expression analysis were obtained from sixteen patients with LV ejection fraction â¥45%. Five out of 16 patients (31%) had echocardiographic characteristics and increased NTproBNP levels indicative of HFpEF and this group was used as HFpEF proxy, while 11 patients had Normal LV physiology. Utilising principal component analysis, the gene expression data clustered into two groups, corresponding to HFpEF proxy and Normal physiology, and 743 differentially expressed genes were identified. The associated top biological functions were cardiac muscle contraction, oxidative phosphorylation, cellular remodelling and matrix organisation. Our results also indicate that upstream regulatory events, including inhibition of transcription factors STAT4, SRF and TP53, and activation of transcription repressors HEY2 and KDM5A, could provide explanatory mechanisms to observed gene expression differences and ultimately cardiac dysfunction in the HFpEF proxy group.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The impact of human mobility on the northern European urban populations during the Viking and Early Middle Ages and its repercussions in Scandinavia itself are still largely unexplored. Our study of the demographics in the final phase of the Viking era is the first comprehensive multidisciplinary investigation that includes genetics, isotopes, archaeology, and osteology on a larger scale. This early Christian dataset is particularly important as the earlier common pagan burial tradition during the Iron Age was cremation, hindering large-scale DNA analyses. We present genome-wide sequence data from 23 individuals from the 10th to 12th century Swedish town of Sigtuna. The data revealed high genetic diversity among the early urban residents. The observed variation exceeds the genetic diversity in distinct modern-day and Iron Age groups of central and northern Europe. Strontium isotope data suggest mixed local and non-local origin of the townspeople. Our results uncover the social system underlying the urbanization process of the Viking World of which mobility was an intricate part and was comparable between males and females. The inhabitants of Sigtuna were heterogeneous in their genetic affinities, probably reflecting both close and distant connections through an established network, confirming that early urbanization processes in northern Europe were driven by migration.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Isopods of the genus Idotea have an unusual ability to feed on algae containing high amounts of chemical defense molecules, such as species of the genera Fucus and Ulva. In this study, we compared gene expression patterns of Idotea balthica individuals fed with Fucus vesiculosus to individuals fed with Ulva lactuca. We generated the first-ever transcriptome assembly for this species, and found 3,233 differentially expressed genes across feeding regimes. However, only a handful of biological functions were enriched with regard to differentially expressed genes, the most notable being "alkaloid metabolic process". Within this category, we found eight differentially expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP) unigenes, all of which had a higher expression in the U. lactuca diet treatment. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the differentially expressed CYP genes are closely related to a CYP gene described from the hepatopancreas of the spiny lobster Panulirus argus, and we hypothesize that these transcripts are involved in metabolite detoxification. This is a first step in the understanding of this algae-grazer interaction, and will form a basis for future work to characterize cytochrome P450 functioning in marine crustaceans.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell formation is essential to gain pluripotency and thus embryogenic potential. The histone modification H3K27me3, which is catalysed by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), regulates important developmental processes in both plants and animals, and defects in PRC2 components cause pleiotropic developmental abnormalities. Nevertheless, the role of H3K27me3 in determining embryogenic potential in gymnosperms is still elusive. To address this, we generated H3K27me3 profiles of Norway spruce (Picea abies) embryonic callus and non-embryogenic callus using CUT&RUN, which is a powerful method for chromatin profiling. Here, we show that H3K27me3 mainly accumulated in genic regions in the Norway spruce genome, similarly to what is observed in other plant species. Interestingly, H3K27me3 levels in embryonic callus were much lower than those in the other examined tissues, but markedly increased upon embryo induction. These results show that H3K27me3 levels are associated with the embryogenic potential of a given tissue, and that the early phase of somatic embryogenesis is accompanied by changes in H3K27me3 levels. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the role of this epigenetic mark in spruce embryogenesis and reinforces the importance of PRC2 as a key regulator of cell fate determination across different plant species.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">ABO blood types and their corresponding antigens have long been assumed to be related to different human diseases. So far, smaller studies on the relationship between mental disorders and blood types yielded contradicting results. In this study we analyzed the association between ABO blood types and lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD). We performed a pooled analysis with data from 26 cohorts that are part of the MDD working group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). The dataset included 37,208 individuals of largely European ancestry of which 41.6% were diagnosed with lifetime MDD. ABO blood types were identified using three single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABO gene: rs505922, rs8176746 and rs8176747. Regression analyses were performed to assess associations between the individual ABO blood types and MDD diagnosis as well as putative interaction effects with sex. The models were adjusted for sex, cohort and the first ten genetic principal components. The percentage of blood type A was slightly lower in cases than controls while blood type O was more prominent in cases. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Our analyses found no evidence of an association between ABO blood types and major depressive disorder.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Accurate estimates of genome-wide rates and fitness effects of new mutations are essential for an improved understanding of molecular evolutionary processes. Although eukaryotic genomes generally contain a large non-coding fraction, functional non-coding regions and fitness effects of mutations in such regions are still incompletely characterized. A promising approach to characterize functional non-coding regions relies on identifying accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) tightly associated with regulatory DNA. Here, we applied this approach to identify and estimate selection on ACRs in Capsella grandiflora, a crucifer species ideal for population genomic quantification of selection due to its favourable population demography. We describe a population-wide ACR distribution based on ATAC-seq data for leaf samples of 16 individuals from a natural population. We use population genomic methods to estimate fitness effects and proportions of positively selected fixations (Î±) in ACRs and find that intergenic ACRs harbor a considerable fraction of weakly deleterious new mutations, as well as a significantly higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations than comparable inaccessible intergenic regions. ACRs are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and depleted of transposable element (TE) insertions, as expected if intergenic ACRs are under selection because they harbor regulatory regions. By integrating empirical identification of intergenic ACRs with analyses of eQTL and population genomic analyses of selection, we demonstrate that intergenic regulatory regions are an important source of nearly neutral mutations. These results improve our understanding of selection on non-coding regions and the role of nearly neutral mutations for evolutionary processes in outcrossing Brassicaceae species.</div>

Transcriptomic analysis, Gene Ontology, and genome-scale metabolic modeling demonstrate changes in pathways related to the prevention of metabolic diseases, particularly with endurance training. Our data also show prominent sex differences between controls and that these differences are reduced with endurance training. Additionally, we compare our data with studies examining muscle gene expression before and after a months-long training period in individuals with metabolic diseases. This analysis reveals that training shifts gene expression in individuals with impaired metabolism to become more similar to our endurance-trained group. Overall, our data provide an extensive examination of the accumulated transcriptional changes that occur with decades-long training and identify important "exercise-responsive" genes that could attenuate metabolic disease.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Epigenetic mechanisms are important in aging and may be involved in late-life changes in cognitive abilities. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of leukocyte DNA methylation in relation to level and change in cognitive abilities, from midlife through late life in 535 Swedish twins.

Methylation levels were measured with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K or Infinium MethylationEPIC array, and all sites passing quality control on both arrays were selected for analysis (n = 250,816). Empirical Bayes estimates of individual intercept (age 65), linear, and quadratic change were obtained from latent growth curve models of cognitive traits and used as outcomes in linear regression models. Significant sites (p < 2.4 Ã 10-7) were followed up in between-within twin pair models adjusting for familial confounding and full-growth modeling. We identified six significant associations between DNA methylation and level of cognitive abilities at age 65: cg18064256 (PPP1R13L) with processing speed and spatial ability; cg04549090 (NRXN3) with spatial ability; cg09988380 (POGZ), cg25651129 (-), and cg08011941 (ENTPD8) with working memory. The genes are involved in neuroinflammation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and ATP metabolism. Within-pair associations were approximately half that of between-pair associations across all sites. In full-growth curve models, associations between DNA methylation and cognitive level at age 65 were of small effect sizes, and associations between DNA methylation and longitudinal change in cognitive abilities of very small effect sizes.

Leukocyte DNA methylation was associated with level, but not change in cognitive abilities. The associations were substantially attenuated in within-pair analyses, indicating they are influenced in part by genetic factors.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Density-dependent pollinator visitation can lead to density-dependent mating patterns and within-population genetic structure. In Gymnadenia conopsea, individuals in low-density patches receive more self pollen than individuals in high-density patches, suggesting higher relatedness at low density. Ongoing fragmentation is also expected to cause more local matings, potentially leading to biparental inbreeding depression.

To evaluate whether relatedness decreases with local density, we analyzed 1315 SNP loci in 113 individuals within two large populations. We quantified within-population genetic structure in one of the populations, recorded potential habitat barriers, and visualized gene flow using estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS). We further estimated the magnitude of biparental inbreeding depression that would result from matings restricted to within 5 m.

There was no significant relationship between local density and relatedness in any population. We detected significant fine-scale genetic structure consistent with isolation by distance, with positive kinship coefficients at distances below 10 m. Kinship coefficients were low, and predicted biparental inbreeding depression resulting from matings within the closest 5 m was a modest 1-3%. The EEMS suggested that rocks and bushes may act as barriers to gene flow within a population.

The results suggest that increased self-pollen deposition in sparse patches does not necessarily cause higher selfing rates or that inbreeding depression results in low establishment success of inbred individuals. The modest relatedness suggests that biparental inbreeding depression is unlikely to be an immediate problem following fragmentation of large populations. The results further indicate that habitat structure may contribute to governing fine-scale genetic structure in G. conopsea.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The complement system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), but most studies have focused on the classical pathway. Ficolin-3 is the main initiator of the lectin pathway of complement in humans, but its role in systemic autoimmune disease has not been conclusively determined. Here, we combined biochemical and genetic approaches to assess the contribution of ficolin-3 to SLE risk and disease manifestations. Ficolin-3 activity was measured by a functional assay in serum or plasma samples from Swedish SLE patients (n = 786) and controls matched for age and sex (n = 566). Genetic variants in an extended 300 kb genomic region spanning the FCN3 locus were analyzed for their association with ficolin-3 activity and SLE manifestations in a Swedish multicenter cohort (n = 985). Patients with ficolin-3 activity in the highest tertile showed a strong enrichment in an SLE cluster defined by anti-Sm/DNA/nucleosome antibodies (OR 3.0, p < 0.001) and had increased rates of hematological disease (OR 1.4, p = 0.078) and lymphopenia (OR = 1.6, p = 0.039). Genetic variants associated with low ficolin-3 activity mapped to an extended haplotype in high linkage disequilibrium upstream of the FCN3 gene. Patients carrying the lead genetic variant associated with low ficolin-3 activity had a lower frequency of hematological disease (OR 0.67, p = 0.018) and lymphopenia (OR 0.63, p = 0.031) and fewer autoantibodies (p = 0.0019). Loss-of-function variants in the FCN3 gene were not associated with SLE, but four (0.5 %) SLE patients developed acquired ficolin-3 deficiency where ficolin-3 activity in serum was depleted following diagnosis of SLE. Taken together, our results provide genetic and biochemical evidence that implicate the lectin pathway in hematological SLE manifestations. We also identify lectin pathway activation through ficolin-3 as a factor that contributes to the autoantibody response in SLE.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Post-acute COVID-19 (PACS) are associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, especially postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Patients with PACS, both in the absence or presence of POTS, exhibit a wide range of persisting symptoms long after the acute infection. Some of these symptoms may stem from alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to provide a broad molecular characterization of patients with PACS with (PACS + POTS) and without (PACS-POTS) POTS compared to healthy subjects, including a broad proteomic characterization with a focus on plasma cardiometabolic proteins, quantification of cytokines/chemokines and determination of plasma sphingolipid levels. Twenty-one healthy subjects without a prior COVID-19 infection (mean age 43 years, 95% females), 20 non-hospitalized patients with PACS + POTS (mean age 39 years, 95% females) and 22 non-hospitalized patients with PACS-POTS (mean age 44 years, 100% females) were studied. PACS patients were non-hospitalized and recruited â18 months after the acute infection. Cardiometabolic proteomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of â200 out of 700 analyzed proteins in both PACS groups vs. healthy subjects with the majority (> 90%) being upregulated. There was a large overlap (> 90%) with no major differences between the PACS groups. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed alterations in hemostasis/coagulation, metabolism, immune responses, and angiogenesis in PACS vs. healthy controls. Furthermore, 11 out of 33 cytokines/chemokines were significantly upregulated both in PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS vs. healthy controls and none of the cytokines were downregulated. There were no differences in between the PACS groups in the cytokine levels. Lastly, 16 and 19 out of 88 sphingolipids were significantly dysregulated in PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS, respectively, compared to controls with no differences between the groups. Collectively, these observations suggest a clear and distinct dysregulation in the proteome, cytokines/chemokines, and sphingolipid levels in PACS patients compared to healthy subjects without any clear signature associated with POTS. This enhances our understanding and might pave the way for future experimental and clinical investigations to elucidate and/or target resolution of inflammation and micro-clots and restore the hemostasis and immunity in PACS.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">In mammals, the gut microbiota has important effects on the health of their hosts. Recent research highlights that animal populations that live in captivity often differ in microbiota diversity and composition from wild populations. However, the changes that may occur when animals move to captivity remain difficult to predict and factors generating such differences are poorly understood. Here we compare the bacterial gut microbiota of wild and captive Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) originating from a population in the southern Kalahari Desert to characterise the changes of the gut microbiota that occur from one generation to the next generation in a long-lived, social rodent species.

We found a clear divergence in the composition of the gut microbiota of captive and wild Damaraland mole-rats. Although the dominating higher-rank bacterial taxa were the same in the two groups, captive animals had an increased ratio of relative abundance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes compared to wild animals. The Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) that were strongly associated with wild animals were commonly members of the same bacterial families as those strongly associated with captive animals. Captive animals had much higher ASV richness compared to wild-caught animals, explained by an increased richness within the Firmicutes.

We found that the gut microbiota of captive hosts differs substantially from the gut microbiota composition of wild hosts. The largest differences between the two groups were found in shifts in relative abundances and diversity of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Parallel adaptation provides valuable insight into the predictability of evolutionary change through replicated natural experiments. A steadily increasing number of studies have demonstrated genomic parallelism, yet the magnitude of this parallelism varies depending on whether populations, species, or genera are compared. This led us to hypothesize that the magnitude of genomic parallelism scales with genetic divergence between lineages, but whether this is the case and the underlying evolutionary processes remain unknown. Here, we resequenced seven parallel lineages of two Arabidopsis species, which repeatedly adapted to challenging alpine environments. By combining genome-wide divergence scans with model-based approaches, we detected a suite of 151 genes that show parallel signatures of positive selection associated with alpine colonization, involved in response to cold, high radiation, short season, herbivores, and pathogens. We complemented these parallel candidates with published gene lists from five additional alpine Brassicaceae and tested our hypothesis on a broad scale spanning â¼0.02 to 18 My of divergence. Indeed, we found quantitatively variable genomic parallelism whose extent significantly decreased with increasing divergence between the compared lineages. We further modeled parallel evolution over the Arabidopsis candidate genes and showed that a decreasing probability of repeated selection on the same standing or introgressed alleles drives the observed pattern of divergence-dependent parallelism. We therefore conclude that genetic divergence between populations, species, and genera, affecting the pool of shared variants, is an important factor in the predictability of genome evolution.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">The continental deep biosphere is suggested to contain a substantial fraction of the earth's total biomass and microorganisms inhabiting this environment likely have a substantial impact on biogeochemical cycles. However, the deep microbial community is still largely unknown and can be influenced by parameters such as temperature, pressure, water residence times, and chemistry of the waters. In this study, 21 boreholes representing a range of deep continental groundwaters from the ÃspÃ¶ Hard Rock Laboratory were subjected to high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize how the different water types influence the microbial communities. Geochemical parameters showed the stability of the waters and allowed their classification into three groups. These were (i) waters influenced by infiltration from the Baltic Sea with a "modern marine (MM)" signature, (ii) a "thoroughly mixed (TM)" water containing groundwaters of several origins, and (iii) deep "old saline (OS)" waters. Decreasing microbial cell numbers positively correlated with depth. In addition, there was a stronger positive correlation between increased cell numbers and dissolved organic carbon for the MM compared to the OS waters. This supported that the MM waters depend on organic carbon infiltration from the Baltic Sea while the ancient saline waters were fed by "geogases" such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The 16S rRNA gene relative abundance of the studied groundwaters revealed different microbial community compositions. Interestingly, the TM water showed the highest dissimilarity compared to the other two water types, potentially due to the several contrasting water types contributing to this groundwater. The main identified microbial phyla in the groundwaters were Gammaproteobacteria, unclassified sequences, Campylobacterota (formerly Epsilonproteobacteria), Patescibacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria. Many of these taxa are suggested to mediate ferric iron and nitrate reduction, especially in the MM waters. This indicated that nitrate reduction may be a neglected but important process in the deep continental biosphere. In addition to the high number of unclassified sequences, almost 50% of the identified phyla were archaeal or bacterial candidate phyla. The percentage of unknown and candidate phyla increased with depth, pointing to the importance and necessity of further studies to characterize deep biosphere microbial populations.</div>

This neurotropic virus, associated with congenital tremor type A-II in piglets, was recently demonstrated to induce the disease through insemination with semen from infected boars.

From 124 Artificial Insemination (AI) doses from Swedish breeding boars, APPV was detected in one dose in addition to a sparse seminal RNA virome, characterised by retroviruses, phages, and some fecal-associated contaminants. The detected seminal microbiome was large and characterized by Gram-negative bacteria from the phylum Proteobacteria, mainly consisting of apathogenic or opportunistic bacteria. The proportion of bacteria with a pathogenic potential was low, and no antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were detected in the datasets.

Overall, the results indicate a good health status among Swedish breeding boars. The detection of APPV in semen raises the question of whether routine screening for APPV in breeding boars should be instigated.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Cutaneous malignant melanoma (melanoma) is characterized by a high mutational load, extensive intertumoral and intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, and complex tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions. Further insights into the mechanisms underlying melanoma are crucial for understanding tumor progression and responses to treatment. Here we adapted the technology of spatial transcriptomics (ST) to melanoma lymph node biopsies and successfully sequenced the transcriptomes of over 2,200 tissue domains. Deconvolution combined with traditional approaches for dimensional reduction of transcriptome-wide data enabled us to both visualize the transcriptional landscape within the tissue and identify gene expression profiles linked to specific histologic entities. Our unsupervised analysis revealed a complex spatial intratumoral composition of melanoma metastases that was not evident through morphologic annotation. Each biopsy showed distinct gene expression profiles and included examples of the coexistence of multiple melanoma signatures within a single tumor region as well as shared profiles for lymphoid tissue characterized according to their spatial location and gene expression profiles. The lymphoid area in close proximity to the tumor region displayed a specific expression pattern, which may reflect the TME, a key component to fully understanding tumor progression. In conclusion, using the ST technology to generate gene expression profiles reveals a detailed landscape of melanoma metastases. This should inspire researchers to integrate spatial information into analyses aiming to identify the factors underlying tumor progression and therapy outcome.Significance: Applying ST technology to gene expression profiling in melanoma lymph node metastases reveals a complex transcriptional landscape in a spatial context, which is essential for understanding the multiple components of tumor progression and therapy outcome.

                    <div class="modal-body small">When new mutations arise at functional sites they are more likely to impair than improve fitness. If not removed by purifying selection, such deleterious mutations will generate a genetic load that can have negative fitness effects in small populations and increase the risk of extinction. This is relevant for the highly inbred Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population, founded by only three wolves in the 1980s and suffering from inbreeding depression. We used functional annotation and evolutionary conservation scores to study deleterious variation in a total of 209 genomes from both the Scandinavian and neighbouring wolf populations in northern Europe. The masked load (deleterious mutations in heterozygote state) was highest in Russia and Finland with deleterious alleles segregating at lower frequency than neutral variation. Genetic drift in the Scandinavian population led to the loss of ancestral alleles, fixation of deleterious variants and a significant increase in the per-individual realized load (deleterious mutations in homozygote state; an increase by 45% in protein-coding genes) over five generations of inbreeding. Arrival of immigrants gave a temporary genetic rescue effect with ancestral alleles re-entering the population and thereby shifting deleterious alleles from homozygous into heterozygote genotypes. However, in the absence of permanent connectivity to Finnish and Russian populations, inbreeding has then again led to the exposure of deleterious mutations. These observations provide genome-wide insight into the magnitude of genetic load and genetic rescue at the molecular level, and in relation to population history. They emphasize the importance of securing gene flow in the management of endangered populations.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Osteoporosis and bone fractures are a severe problem for the welfare of laying hens, with genetics and environment, such as housing system, each making substantial contributions to bone strength. In this work, we performed genetic analyses of bone strength, bone mineral density and bone composition, as well as body weight, in 860 commercial crossbred laying hens from two different companies, kept in either furnished cages or floor pens. We compared bone traits between housing systems and crossbreds, and performed a genome-wide association study of bone properties and body weight. As expected, the two housing systems produced a large difference in bone strength, with layers housed in floor pens having stronger bones. These differences were accompanied by differences in bone geometry, mineralisation and chemical composition. Genome-scans either combining or independently analysing the two housing systems revealed no genome-wide significant loci for bone breaking strength. We detected three loci for body weight that were shared between the housing systems on chromosomes 4, 6 and 27 (either genome-wide significant or suggestive) and these coincide with associations for bone length. In summary, we found substantial differences in bone strength, content and composition between hens kept in floor pens and furnished cages that could be attributed to greater physical activity in pen housing. We found little evidence for large-effect loci for bone strength in commercial crossbred hens, consistent with a highly polygenic architecture for bone strength in the production environment.â The lack of consistent genetic associations between housing systems in combination with the differences in bone phenotypes could be due to gene-by-environment interactions with housing system or a lack of power to detect shared associations for bone strength.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Loss of recombination between sex chromosomes often depletes Y chromosomes of functional content and genetic variation, which might limit their potential to generate adaptive diversity. Males of the freshwater fish Poecilia parae occur as one of five discrete morphs, all of which shoal together in natural populations where morph frequency has been stable for over 50 years. Each morph uses a different complex reproductive strategy and morphs differ dramatically in colour, body size and mating behaviour. Morph phenotype is passed perfectly from father to son, indicating there are five Y haplotypes segregating in the species, which encode the complex male morph characteristics. Here, we examine Y diversity in natural populations of P. parae. Using linked-read sequencing on multiple P. parae females and males of all five morphs, we find that the genetic architecture of the male morphs evolved on the Y chromosome after recombination suppression had occurred with the X. Comparing Y chromosomes between each of the morphs, we show that, although the Ys of the three minor morphs that differ in colour are highly similar, there are substantial amounts of unique genetic material and divergence between the Ys of the three major morphs that differ in reproductive strategy, body size and mating behaviour. Altogether, our results suggest that the Y chromosome is able to overcome the constraints of recombination loss to generate extreme diversity, resulting in five discrete Y chromosomes that control complex reproductive strategies.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Peatlands are generally important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) to adjacent aquatic ecosystems, increasing the risk of human and wildlife exposure to this highly toxic compound. While microorganisms play important roles in mercury (Hg) geochemical cycles where they directly and indirectly affect MeHg formation in peatlands, potential linkages between net MeHg formation and microbial communities involving these microorganisms remain unclear. To address this gap, microbial community composition and specific marker gene transcripts were investigated along a trophic gradient in a geographically constrained peatland chronosequence. Our results showed a clear spatial pattern in microbial community composition along the gradient that was highly driven by peat soil properties and significantly associated with net MeHg formation as approximated by MeHg concentration and %MeHg of total Hg concentration. Known fermentative, syntrophic, methanogenic and iron-reducing metabolic guilds had the strong positive correlations to net MeHg formation, while methanotrophic and methylotrophic microorganisms were negatively correlated. Our results indicated that sulfate reducers did not have a key role in net MeHg formation. Microbial activity as interpreted from 16S rRNA sequences was significantly correlated with MeHg and %MeHg. Our findings shed new light on the role of microbial community in net MeHg formation of peatlands that undergo ontogenetic change.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Coccidiosis is an infectious disease with large negative impact on the poultry industry worldwide. It is an enteric infection caused by unicellular Apicomplexan parasites of the genus Eimeria. The present study aimed to gain more knowledge about interactions between parasites and the host immune system during the early asexual replication phase of E. tenella in chicken caeca. For this purpose, chickens were experimentally infected with E. tenella oocysts, sacrificed on days 1-4 and 10 after infection and mRNA from caecal tissues was extracted and sequenced.

Dual RNA-seq analysis revealed time-dependent changes in both host and parasite gene expression during the course of the infection. Chicken immune activation was detected from day 3 and onwards with the highest number of differentially expressed immune genes recorded on day 10. Among early (days 3-4) responses up-regulation of genes for matrix metalloproteinases, several chemokines, interferon (IFN)-Î³ along with IFN-stimulated genes GBP, IRF1 and RSAD2 were noted. Increased expression of genes with immune suppressive/regulatory effects, e.g. IL10, SOCS1, SOCS3, was also observed among early responses. For E. tenella a general up-regulation of genes involved in protein expression and energy metabolism as well as a general down-regulation genes for DNA and RNA processing were observed during the infection. Specific E. tenella genes with altered expression during the experiment include those for proteins in rhoptry and microneme organelles.

The present study provides novel information on both the transcriptional activity of E. tenella during schizogony in ceacal tissue and of the local host responses to parasite invasion during this phase of infection. Results indicate a role for IFN-Î³ and IFN-stimulated genes in the innate defence against Eimeria replication.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Intravasation, vascular dissemination and metastasis of malignant tumor cells require their passage through the vascular wall which is commonly composed of pericytes and endothelial cells. We currently decided to investigate the relative contribution of these cell types to B16F10 melanoma metastasis in mice using an experimental model of host Shb gene (Src homology 2 domain-containing protein B) inactivation. Conditional inactivation of Shb in endothelial cells using Cdh5-CreERt2 resulted in decreased tumor growth, reduced vascular leakage, increased hypoxia and no effect on pericyte coverage and lung metastasis. RNAseq of tumor endothelial cells from these mice revealed changes in cellular components such as adherens junctions and focal adhesions by gene ontology analysis that were in line with the observed effects on leakage and junction morphology. Conditional inactivation of Shb in pericytes using Pdgfrb-CreERt2 resulted in decreased pericyte coverage of small tumor vessels with lumen, increased leakage, aberrant platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB) signaling and a higher frequency of lung metastasis without concomitant effects on tumor growth or oxygenation. Flow cytometry failed to reveal immune cell alterations that could explain the metastatic phenotype in this genetic model of Shb deficiency. It is concluded that proper pericyte function plays a significant role in suppressing B16F10 lung metastasis.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body small">Although metagenomics and metatranscriptomics are commonly used to identify bacteria and viruses in human samples, few studies directly compare these strategies. We wished to compare DNA and RNA sequencing of bacterial and viral metagenomes and metatranscriptomes in the human cervix. Total nucleic acids from six human cervical samples were subjected to DNA and RNA sequencing. The effect of DNase-treatment before reverse transcription to cDNA were also analyzed. Similarities and differences in the metagenomic findings with the three different sequencing approaches were evaluated. A higher proportion of human sequences were detected by DNA sequencing (93%) compared to RNA sequencing without (76%) and with prior DNase-treatment (11%). On the contrary, bacterial sequences increased 17 and 91 times. However, the number of detected bacterial genera were less by RNA sequencing, suggesting that only a few contribute to most of the bacterial transcripts. The viral sequences were less by RNA sequencing, still twice as many virus genera were detected, including some RNA viruses that were missed by DNA sequencing. Metatranscriptomics of total cDNA provided improved detection of mainly transcribed bacteria and viruses in cervical swabs as well as detection of RNA viruses, compared to metagenomics.</div>
