    "title": "INT-Hi-C reveals distinct chromatin architecture in endosperm and leaf tissues of Arabidopsis.",
    "abstract": "Higher-order chromatin structure undergoes striking changes in response to various developmental and environmental signals, causing distinct cell types to adopt specific chromatin organization. High throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) allows studying higher-order chromatin structure; however, this technique requires substantial amounts of starting material, which has limited the establishment of cell type-specific higher-order chromatin structure in plants. To overcome this limitation, we established a protocol that is applicable to a limited amount of nuclei by combining the INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) method and Hi-C (INT-Hi-C). Using this INT-Hi-C protocol, we generated Hi-C data from INTACT purified endosperm and leaf nuclei. Our INT-Hi-C data from leaf accurately reiterated chromatin interaction patterns derived from conventional leaf Hi-C data. We found that the higher-order chromatin organization of mixed leaf tissues and endosperm differs and that DNA methylation and repressive histone marks positively correlate with the chromatin compaction level. We furthermore found that self-looped interacting genes have increased expression in leaves and endosperm and that interacting intergenic regions negatively impact on gene expression in the endosperm. Last, we identified several imprinted genes involved in long-range and trans interactions exclusively in endosperm. Our study provides evidence that the endosperm adopts a distinct higher-order chromatin structure that differs from other cell types in plants and that chromatin interactions influence transcriptional activity.",

    "title": "The genetic regulation of size variation in the transcriptome of the cerebrum in the chicken and its role in domestication and brain size evolution.",
    "abstract": "Large difference in cerebrum size exist between avian species and populations of the same species and is believed to reflect differences in processing power, i.e. in the speed and efficiency of processing information in this brain region. During domestication chickens developed a larger cerebrum compared to their wild progenitor, the Red jungle fowl. The underlying mechanisms that control cerebrum size and the extent to which genetic regulation is similar across brain regions is not well understood. In this study, we combine measurement of cerebrum size with genome-wide genetical genomics analysis to identify the genetic architecture of the cerebrum, as well as compare the regulation of gene expression in this brain region with gene expression in other regions of the brain (the hypothalamus) and somatic tissue (liver).\n\nWe identify one candidate gene that putatively regulates cerebrum size (MTF2) as well as a large number of eQTL that regulate the transcriptome in cerebrum tissue, with the majority of these eQTL being trans-acting. The overall regulation of gene expression variation in the cerebrum was markedly different to the hypothalamus, with relatively few eQTL in common. In comparison, the cerebrum tissue shared more eQTL with a distant tissue (liver) than with a neighboring tissue (hypothalamus).\n\nThe candidate gene for cerebrum size (MTF2) has previously been linked to brain development making it a good candidate for further investigation as a regulator of inter-population variation in cerebrum size. The lack of shared eQTL between the two brain regions implies that genetic regulation of gene expression appears to be relatively independent between the two brain regions and suggest that coevolution between these two brain regions might be more functionally driven than developmental. These findings have relevance for current brain size evolution theories.",

Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 1,635 patients with IgAD and 4,852 controls identified four new significant (P < 5 × 10(-8)) loci and association with a rare IFIH1 variant (p.Ile923Val). Peak new variants (PVT1, P = 4.3 × 10(-11); ATG13-AMBRA1, P = 6.7 × 10(-10); AHI1, P = 8.4 × 10(-10); CLEC16A, P = 1.4 × 10(-9)) overlapped with autoimmune markers (3/4) and correlated with 21 putative regulatory variants, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for AHI1 and DEXI and DNase hypersensitivity sites in FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells. Pathway analysis of the meta-analysis results showed striking association with the KEGG pathway for IgA production (pathway P < 0.0001), with 22 of the 30 annotated pathway genes containing at least one variant with P ≤ 0.05 in the IgAD meta-analysis. These data suggest that a complex network of genetic effects, including genes known to influence the biology of IgA production, contributes to IgAD.",

    "title": "Genetic insights into biological mechanisms governing human ovarian ageing.",
    "abstract": "Reproductive longevity is essential for fertility and influences healthy ageing in women1,2, but insights into its underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease.",

    "title": "Evidence for three genetic loci involved in both anorexia nervosa risk and variation of body mass index.",
    "abstract": "The maintenance of normal body weight is disrupted in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) for prolonged periods of time. Prior to the onset of AN, premorbid body mass index (BMI) spans the entire range from underweight to obese. After recovery, patients have reduced rates of overweight and obesity. As such, loci involved in body weight regulation may also be relevant for AN and vice versa. Our primary analysis comprised a cross-trait analysis of the 1000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the lowest P-values in a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of AN (GCAN) for evidence of association in the largest published GWAMA for BMI (GIANT). Subsequently we performed sex-stratified analyses for these 1000 SNPs. Functional ex vivo studies on four genes ensued. Lastly, a look-up of GWAMA-derived BMI-related loci was performed in the AN GWAMA. We detected significant associations (P-values <5 × 10(-5), Bonferroni-corrected P<0.05) for nine SNP alleles at three independent loci. Interestingly, all AN susceptibility alleles were consistently associated with increased BMI. None of the genes (chr. 10: CTBP2, chr. 19: CCNE1, chr. 2: CARF and NBEAL1; the latter is a region with high linkage disequilibrium) nearest to these SNPs has previously been associated with AN or obesity. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the strongest BMI signal originated predominantly from females (chr. 10 rs1561589; Poverall: 2.47 × 10(-06)/Pfemales: 3.45 × 10(-07)/Pmales: 0.043). Functional ex vivo studies in mice revealed reduced hypothalamic expression of Ctbp2 and Nbeal1 after fasting. Hypothalamic expression of Ctbp2 was increased in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice as compared with age-matched lean controls. We observed no evidence for associations for the look-up of BMI-related loci in the AN GWAMA. A cross-trait analysis of AN and BMI loci revealed variants at three chromosomal loci with potential joint impact. The chromosome 10 locus is particularly promising given that the association with obesity was primarily driven by females. In addition, the detected altered hypothalamic expression patterns of Ctbp2 and Nbeal1 as a result of fasting and DIO implicate these genes in weight regulation.",

    "title": "Comparative genomics of Mycobacterium mucogenicum and Mycobacterium neoaurum clade members emphasizing tRNA and non-coding RNA.",
    "abstract": "Mycobacteria occupy various ecological niches and can be isolated from soil, tap water and ground water. Several cause diseases in humans and animals. To get deeper insight into our understanding of mycobacterial evolution focusing on tRNA and non-coding (nc)RNA, we conducted a comparative genome analysis of Mycobacterium mucogenicum (Mmuc) and Mycobacterium neoaurum (Mneo) clade members.\n\nGenome sizes for Mmuc- and Mneo-clade members vary between 5.4 and 6.5 Mbps with the complete Mmuc T (type strain) genome encompassing 6.1 Mbp. The number of tRNA genes range between 46 and 79 (including one pseudo tRNA gene) with 39 tRNA genes common among the members of these clades, while additional tRNA genes were probably acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Selected tRNAs and ncRNAs (RNase P RNA, tmRNA, 4.5S RNA, Ms1 RNA and 6C RNA) are expressed, and the levels for several of these are higher in stationary phase compared to exponentially growing cells. The rare tRNAIleTAT isoacceptor and two for mycobacteria novel ncRNAs: the Lactobacillales-derived GOLLD RNA and a homolog to the antisense Salmonella typhimurium phage Sar RNA, were shown to be present and expressed in certain Mmuc-clade members.\n\nPhages, IS elements, horizontally transferred tRNA gene clusters, and phage-derived ncRNAs appears to have influenced the evolution of the Mmuc- and Mneo-clades. While the number of predicted coding sequences correlates with genome size, the number of tRNA coding genes does not. The majority of the tRNA genes in mycobacteria are transcribed mainly from single genes and the levels of certain ncRNAs, including RNase P RNA (essential for the processing of tRNAs), are higher at stationary phase compared to exponentially growing cells. We provide supporting evidence that Ms1 RNA represents a mycobacterial 6S RNA variant. The evolutionary routes for the ncRNAs RNase P RNA, tmRNA and Ms1 RNA are different from that of the core genes.",

    "title": "Distinct global binding patterns of the Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) -KTS and +KTS isoforms in leukemic cells.",
    "abstract": "The zinc finger transcription factor Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) acts as an oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia. A naturally occurring alternative splice event between zinc fingers three and four, removing or retaining three amino acids (±KTS), is believed to change the DNA binding affinity of WT1, although there are conflicting data regarding the binding affinity and motifs of the different isoforms. Increased expression of the WT1 -KTS isoform at the expense of the WT1 +KTS isoform is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. We determined the genome-wide binding pattern of WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS in leukemic K562 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. We discovered that the WT1 -KTS isoform predominantly binds close to transcription start sites and to enhancers, in a similar fashion to other transcription factors, whereas WT1 +KTS binding is enriched within gene bodies. We observed a significant overlap between WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes, despite the binding sites being distinct. Motif discovery revealed distinct binding motifs for the isoforms, some of which have been previously reported as WT1 binding sites. Additional analyses showed that both WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes are more likely to be transcribed than non-targets, and are involved in cell proliferation, cell death, and development. Our study provides evidence that WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS share target genes yet still bind distinct locations, indicating isoform-specific regulation in transcription of genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation, consistent with the involvement of WT1 in acute myeloid leukemia.",

    "title": "Comparison of EM-seq and PBAT methylome library methods for low-input DNA.",
    "abstract": "DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark involved in regulation of gene expression. For low input samples, a limited number of methods for quantifying DNA methylation genome-wide has been evaluated. Here, we compared a series of input DNA amounts (1-10ng) from two methylome library preparation protocols, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) and post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT) adapted from single-cell PBAT. EM-seq takes advantage of enzymatic activity while PBAT relies on conventional bisulfite conversion for detection of DNA methylation. We found that both methods accurately quantified DNA methylation genome-wide. They produced expected distribution patterns around genomic features, high C-T transition efficiency at non-CpG sites and high correlation between input amounts. However, EM-seq performed better in regard to library and sequencing quality, i.e. EM-seq produced larger insert sizes, higher alignment rates and higher library complexity with lower duplication rate compared to PBAT. Moreover, EM-seq demonstrated higher CpG coverage, better CpG site overlap and higher consistency between input series. In summary, our data suggests that EM-seq overall performed better than PBAT in whole-genome methylation quantification of low input samples.",

    "title": "Contribution of copy number variants to schizophrenia from a genome-wide study of 41,321 subjects.",
    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) have been strongly implicated in the genetic etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ). However, genome-wide investigation of the contribution of CNV to risk has been hampered by limited sample sizes. We sought to address this obstacle by applying a centralized analysis pipeline to a SCZ cohort of 21,094 cases and 20,227 controls. A global enrichment of CNV burden was observed in cases (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, P = 5.7 × 10 -15), which persisted after excluding loci implicated in previous studies (OR = 1.07, P = 1.7 × 10-6). CNV burden was enriched for genes associated with synaptic function (OR = 1.68, P = 2.8 × 10-11) and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mouse (OR = 1.18, P = 7.3 × 10-5). Genome-wide significant evidence was obtained for eight loci, including 1q21.1, 2p16.3 (NRXN1), 3q29, 7q11.2, 15q13.3, distal 16p11.2, proximal 16p11.2 and 22q11.2. Suggestive support was found for eight additional candidate susceptibility and protective loci, which consisted predominantly of CNVs mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination.",

    "title": "Temporally balanced selection during development of larval Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) inherently preserves genetic diversity within offspring.",
    "abstract": "Balancing selection is one of the mechanisms which has been proposed to explain the maintenance of genetic diversity in species across generations. For species with large populations and complex life histories, however, heterogeneous selection pressures may create a scenario in which the net effects of selection are balanced across developmental stages. With replicated cultures and a pooled sequencing approach, we show that genotype-dependent mortality in larvae of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is largely temporally dynamic and inconsistently in favour of a single genotype or allelic variant at each locus. Overall, the patterns of genetic change we observe to be taking place are more complex than what would be expected under classical examples of additive or dominant genetic interactions. They are also not easily explained by our current understanding of the effects of genetic load. Collectively, temporally heterogeneous selection pressures across different larval developmental stages may act to maintain genetic diversity, while also inherently sheltering genetic load within oyster populations.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is accelerated in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).\r\n\r\nTo test whether this reflects differential genetic influences on CAD risk in subjects with T2D, we performed a systematic assessment of genetic overlap between CAD and T2D in 66 643 subjects (27 708 with CAD and 24 259 with T2D). Variants showing apparent association with CAD in stratified analyses or evidence of interaction were evaluated in a further 117 787 subjects (16 694 with CAD and 11 537 with T2D).\r\n\r\nNone of the previously characterized CAD loci was found to have specific effects on CAD in T2D individuals, and a genome-wide interaction analysis found no new variants for CAD that could be considered T2D specific. When we considered the overall genetic correlations between CAD and its risk factors, we found no substantial differences in these relationships by T2D background.\r\n\r\nThis study found no evidence that the genetic architecture of CAD differs in those with T2D compared with those without T2D.",

    "title": "The genomic footprint of sexual conflict.",
    "abstract": "Genes with sex-biased expression show a number of unique properties and this has been seen as evidence for conflicting selection pressures in males and females, forming a genetic 'tug-of-war' between the sexes. However, we lack studies of taxa where an understanding of conflicting phenotypic selection in the sexes has been linked with studies of genomic signatures of sexual conflict. Here, we provide such a link. We used an insect where sexual conflict is unusually well understood, the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, to test for molecular genetic signals of sexual conflict across genes with varying degrees of sex-bias in expression. We sequenced, assembled and annotated its genome and performed population resequencing of three divergent populations. Sex-biased genes showed increased levels of genetic diversity and bore a remarkably clear footprint of relaxed purifying selection. Yet, segregating genetic variation was also affected by balancing selection in weakly female-biased genes, while male-biased genes showed signs of overall purifying selection. Female-biased genes contributed disproportionally to shared polymorphism across populations, while male-biased genes, male seminal fluid protein genes and sex-linked genes did not. Genes showing genomic signatures consistent with sexual conflict generally matched life-history phenotypes known to experience sexually antagonistic selection in this species. Our results highlight metabolic and reproductive processes, confirming the key role of general life-history traits in sexual conflict.",

    "abstract": "To test the association of a recently reported variant in the creatine kinase (CK) muscle gene, CKM Glu83Gly (rs11559024) with constitutive creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels, CK variation, and inducibility. Given the diagnostic importance of CK in determining muscle damage, we tested the association of the variant with myalgia.\n\nMeta-analysis between longitudinal cohort GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research, Tayside Scotland), minor allele frequency (=0.02), and randomized clinical trial (JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin], minor allele frequency=0.018) was used to replicate the association with baseline CK measures. GoDARTS was used to study the relationship with CK variability. Myalgia was studied in JUPITER trial participants. Baseline and SDs of CK were on average 18% ( P value=6×10-63) and 24% (P value=2×10-5) lower for carriers of the variant, respectively. The variant was not associated with myalgia (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.38).\n\nThis study highlights that a genetic factor known to be associated with constitutive CK levels is also associated with CK variability and inducibility. This is discussed in the context of evidence to suggest that the variant has an impact on inducibility of CK by trauma through a previously reported case of a homozygous carrier. However, the lack of association between the variant and myalgia suggests that it cannot reliably be used as a biomarker for muscle symptoms.",

    "title": "A DNA methylation site within the KLF13 gene is associated with orexigenic processes based on neural responses and ghrelin levels.",
    "abstract": "We investigated five methylation markers recently linked to body mass index, for their role in the neuropathology of obesity. In neuroimaging experiments, our analysis involving 23 participants showed that methylation levels for the cg07814318 site, which lies within the KLF13 gene, correlated with brain activity in the claustrum, putamen, cingulate gyrus and frontal gyri, some of which have been previously associated to food signaling, obesity or reward. Methylation levels at cg07814318 also positively correlated with ghrelin levels. Moreover, expression of KLF13 was augmented in the brains of obese and starved mice. Our results suggest the cg07814318 site could be involved in orexigenic processes, and also implicate KLF13 in obesity. Our findings are the first to associate methylation levels in blood with brain activity in obesity-related regions, and further support previous findings between ghrelin, brain activity and genetic differences.",

We performed array-based DNA methylation profiling of KMT2Ar ALL cells from 26 children in comparison to normal B-cell precursors. Significant changes in DNA methylation in KMT2Ar ALL were identified in 2,545 CpG loci, influenced by age and the translocation partners AFF1 and MLLT1. In KMT2Ar ALL, DNA methylation loss was enriched at enhancers and for certain transcription factor binding sites such as BCL11A, EBF, and MEF2A. In summary, DNA methylation changes in KMT2Ar ALL target enhancers, genes involved in leukemogenesis and normal hematopoiesis, as well as transcription factor networks.",

    "abstract": "To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of adiposity and its links to cardiometabolic disease risk, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of body fat percentage (BF%) in up to 100,716 individuals. Twelve loci reached genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), of which eight were previously associated with increased overall adiposity (BMI, BF%) and four (in or near COBLL1/GRB14, IGF2BP1, PLA2G6, CRTC1) were novel associations with BF%. Seven loci showed a larger effect on BF% than on BMI, suggestive of a primary association with adiposity, while five loci showed larger effects on BMI than on BF%, suggesting association with both fat and lean mass. In particular, the loci more strongly associated with BF% showed distinct cross-phenotype association signatures with a range of cardiometabolic traits revealing new insights in the link between adiposity and disease risk.",

    "title": "Introduction and persistence of tularemia in Bulgaria.",
    "abstract": "Outbreaks of the zoonotic disease tularemia occurred in north-east Bulgaria in the 1960s. Then came 30 years of epidemiological silence until new outbreaks occurred in west Bulgaria in the 1990s. To investigate how bacterial strains of Francisella tularensis causing tularemia in wildlife and humans in the 1960s and the 1990s were related, we explored their genetic diversity.\n\nTen F. tularensis genomes from the 1960s (n=3) and the 1990s (n=7) were sequenced, assigned to canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) clades, and compared to reference genomes. We developed four new canSNP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on the genome sequence information.\n\nThe genetic analysis showed that the outbreaks in the 1960s as well as in the 1990s involved multiple clones and new genetic diversity. The smallest genetic difference found between any of the Bulgarian strains was five SNPs between the strains L2 and 81 isolated 43 years apart, indicating that F. tularensis may persist locally over long time periods without causing outbreaks. The existence of genetically highly similar strain-pairs isolated the same year in the same area from different hosts supports a hypothesis of local expansion of clones during outbreaks. Close relationship (two SNPs) was found between one strain isolated 1961 in northeast Bulgaria and one strain isolated 5 years before in USSR. Historical data coinciding with the actual time point describe the introduction of water rats from USSR into the Bulgarian outbreak area, which may explain the close genetic relationship and the origin of the outbreak.\n\nGenome analysis of strains from two outbreaks in the 1960s and the 1990s provided valuable information on the genetic diversity and persistence of F. tularensis in Bulgaria.",

    "title": "A Genetic Risk Score Is Associated with Weight Loss Following Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Currently, Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most efficient therapy for severe obesity. Weight loss after surgery is, however, highly variable and genetically influenced. Genome-wide association studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). We aimed to identify two genetic risk scores (GRS) composed of weighted BMI and WHR-associated SNPs to estimate their impact on excess BMI loss (EBMIL) after RYGB surgery.\n\nTwo hundred and thirty-eight obese patients (BMI 45.1 ± 6.2 kg/m(2), 74 % women), who underwent RYGB, were genotyped for 35 BMI and WHR-associated SNPs and were followed up after 2 years. SNPs with high impact on post-surgical weight loss were filtered out using a random forest model. The filtered SNPs were combined into a GRS and analyzed in a linear regression model.\n\nAn up to 11 % lower EBMIL with higher risk score was estimated for two GRS models (P = 0.026 resp. P = 0.021) composed of seven BMI-associated SNPs (closest genes: MC4R, TMEM160, PTBP2, NUDT3, TFAP2B, ZNF608, MAP2K5, GNPDA2, and MTCH2) and of three WHR-associated SNPs (closest genes: HOXC13, LYPLAL1, and DNM3-PIGC). Patients within the lowest GRS quartile had higher EBMIL compared to patients within the other three quartiles in both models.\n\nWe identified two GRSs composed of BMI and WHR-associated SNPs with significant impact on weight loss after RYGB surgery using random forest analysis as a SNP selection tool. The GRS may be useful to pre-surgically evaluate the risks for patients undergoing RYGB surgery.",

    "title": "Genetic identification of cell types underlying brain complex traits yields insights into the etiology of Parkinson's disease.",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have discovered hundreds of loci associated with complex brain disorders, but it remains unclear in which cell types these loci are active. Here we integrate genome-wide association study results with single-cell transcriptomic data from the entire mouse nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlying brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with projecting excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, Parkinson's disease was genetically associated not only with cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (which include dopaminergic neurons) but also with enteric neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression. Our study provides an important framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain maladies, and reveals an unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson's disease.",

    "title": "Environmentally induced DNA methylation is inherited across generations in an aquatic keystone species.",
    "abstract": "Transgenerational inheritance of environmentally induced epigenetic marks can have significant impacts on eco-evolutionary dynamics, but the phenomenon remains controversial in ecological model systems. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of individual water fleas (Daphnia magna) to assess whether environmentally induced DNA methylation is transgenerationally inherited. Genetically identical females were exposed to one of three natural stressors, or a de-methylating drug, and their offspring were propagated clonally for four generations under control conditions. We identified between 70 and 225 differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) in F1 individuals whose mothers were exposed to a natural stressor. Roughly half of these environmentally induced DMPs persisted until generation F4. In contrast, treatment with the drug demonstrated that pervasive hypomethylation upon exposure is reset almost completely after one generation. These results suggest that environmentally induced DNA methylation is non-random and stably inherited across generations in Daphnia, making epigenetic inheritance a putative factor in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of freshwater communities.",

    "abstract": "Biological age measurements (BAs) assess aging-related physiological change and predict health risks among individuals of the same chronological age (CA). Multiple BAs have been proposed and are well studied individually but not jointly. We included 845 individuals and 3973 repeated measurements from a Swedish population-based cohort and examined longitudinal trajectories, correlations, and mortality associations of nine BAs across 20 years follow-up. We found the longitudinal growth of functional BAs accelerated around age 70; average levels of BA curves differed by sex across the age span (50-90 years). All BAs were correlated to varying degrees; correlations were mostly explained by CA. Individually, all BAs except for telomere length were associated with mortality risk independently of CA. The largest effects were seen for methylation age estimators (GrimAge) and the frailty index (FI). In joint models, two methylation age estimators (Horvath and GrimAge) and FI remained predictive, suggesting they are complementary in predicting mortality.",

    "abstract": "Reduced glomerular filtration rate defines chronic kidney disease and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), combining data across 133,413 individuals with replication in up to 42,166 individuals. We identify 24 new and confirm 29 previously identified loci. Of these 53 loci, 19 associate with eGFR among individuals with diabetes. Using bioinformatics, we show that identified genes at eGFR loci are enriched for expression in kidney tissues and in pathways relevant for kidney development and transmembrane transporter activity, kidney structure, and regulation of glucose metabolism. Chromatin state mapping and DNase I hypersensitivity analyses across adult tissues demonstrate preferential mapping of associated variants to regulatory regions in kidney but not extra-renal tissues. These findings suggest that genetic determinants of eGFR are mediated largely through direct effects within the kidney and highlight important cell types and biological pathways.",

    "abstract": "Long-term pre-breeding using Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum as a donor of bird cherry-oat aphid resistance has resulted in agronomically improved resistance sources of barley along with easy-to-use molecular markers. Bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) is a pest and a virus vector in barley to which there are no bred-resistant cultivars. The present study describes how resistance from Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum has been introgressed in cultivated barley via five successive crosses with the same cultivar Lina (BC) and in parallel with other more modern barley cultivars. Most of the selections for resistance are based on measurements of individual aphid growth in the laboratory. This very slow phenotyping method has been complemented by molecular marker evaluation and application in part of the breeding material. Doubled haploid production in each generation has been crucial for more precise selection of lines with the quantitatively expressed resistance. A field trial of selected \"BC\n            3\"-generation lines essentially confirmed the laboratory results, so did genotyping of the whole pedigree of parents and selected \"BC2\" and \"BC4\" offspring lines. The Infinium iSelect 50 K SNP assay confirmed relationships between lines and discerned several new markers for a resistance QTL on chromosome 2H.",

    "title": "Multiple migrations to the Philippines during the last 50,000 years.",
    "abstract": "Island Southeast Asia has recently produced several surprises regarding human history, but the region's complex demography remains poorly understood. Here, we report ∼2.3 million genotypes from 1,028 individuals representing 115 indigenous Philippine populations and genome-sequence data from two ∼8,000-y-old individuals from Liangdao in the Taiwan Strait. We show that the Philippine islands were populated by at least five waves of human migration: initially by Northern and Southern Negritos (distantly related to Australian and Papuan groups), followed by Manobo, Sama, Papuan, and Cordilleran-related populations. The ancestors of Cordillerans diverged from indigenous peoples of Taiwan at least ∼8,000 y ago, prior to the arrival of paddy field rice agriculture in the Philippines ∼2,500 y ago, where some of their descendants remain to be the least admixed East Asian groups carrying an ancestry shared by all Austronesian-speaking populations. These observations contradict an exclusive \"out-of-Taiwan\" model of farming-language-people dispersal within the last four millennia for the Philippines and Island Southeast Asia. Sama-related ethnic groups of southwestern Philippines additionally experienced some minimal South Asian gene flow starting ∼1,000 y ago. Lastly, only a few lowlanders, accounting for <1% of all individuals, presented a low level of West Eurasian admixture, indicating a limited genetic legacy of Spanish colonization in the Philippines. Altogether, our findings reveal a multilayered history of the Philippines, which served as a crucial gateway for the movement of people that ultimately changed the genetic landscape of the Asia-Pacific region.",

    "title": "A genomic exploration identifies mechanisms that may explain adverse cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (coxibs) are characterized by multiple molecular off-target effects and increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Here, we systematically explored common variants of genes representing molecular targets of coxibs for association with CAD. Given a broad spectrum of pleiotropic effects of coxibs, our intention was to narrow potential mechanisms affecting CAD risk as we hypothesized that the affected genes may also display genomic signals of coronary disease risk. A Drug Gene Interaction Database search identified 47 gene products to be affected by coxibs. We traced association signals in 200-kb regions surrounding these genes in 84,813 CAD cases and 202,543 controls. Based on a threshold of 1 × 10(-5) (Bonferroni correction for 3131 haplotype blocks), four gene loci yielded significant associations. The lead SNPs were rs7270354 (MMP9), rs4888383 (BCAR1), rs6905288 (VEGFA1), and rs556321 (CACNA1E). By additional genotyping, rs7270354 at MMP9 and rs4888383 at BCAR1 also reached the established GWAS threshold for genome-wide significance. The findings demonstrate overlap of genes affected by coxibs and those mediating CAD risk and points to further mechanisms, which are potentially responsible for coxib-associated CAD risk. The novel approach furthermore suggests that genetic studies may be useful to explore the clinical relevance of off-target drug effects.",

    "abstract": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome usually caused by loss-of-function mutations in the MEN1 gene. However, a minority of patients who fulfill the criteria for MEN1 are not found to harbor MEN1 mutations. Besides, some of these individuals, present with a subtly different phenotype suggestive of sporadic disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic architecture of mutation-negative MEN1.\n\nFourteen patients with a clinical diagnosis (n = 13) or suspicion (n = 1) of MEN1 who had negative genetic screening of the MEN1 gene were included.\n\nConstitutional DNA from the included patients, as well as tumor DNA from six of the patients, was subjected to whole genome sequencing. Constitutional variants were filtered against population databases and somatic variants were studied under a tumor-suppressor model.\n\nThree patients carried pathogenic variants (two splice-site variants, one missense variant) in MEN1 that had not been detected during routine clinical sequencing, one patient carried a pathogenic variant in CASR and one patient carried a gross deletion on chromosome 1q which included the CDC73 gene. Analysis of matched tumor DNA from six patients without mutations did not detect any recurrent genes fulfilling Knudson's two-hit model.\n\nThese results highlight the possibility of germline mutations being missed in routine screening, the importance of considering phenocopies in atypical or mutation-negative cases. The absence of apparent disease-causing mutations suggests that a fraction of MEN1 mutation-negative MEN1 cases may be due to the chance occurrence of several endocrine tumors in one patient.",

    "abstract": "Slow degradation kinetics of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and their accumulation in anaerobic digesters disrupt methanogenic activity and biogas production at high loads of waste lipids. In this study, we evaluated the effect of effluent solids recirculation on microbial LCFA (oleate) degradation capacity in continuous stirred-tank sludge digesters, with the overall aim of providing operating conditions for efficient co-digestion of waste lipids. Furthermore, the impacts of LCFA feeding frequency and sulfide on process performance and microbial community dynamics were investigated, as parameters that were previously shown to be influential on LCFA conversion to biogas.\n\nEffluent solids recirculation to municipal sludge digesters enabled biogas production of up to 78% of the theoretical potential from 1.0 g oleate l-1 day-1. In digesters without effluent recirculation, comparable conversion efficiency could only be reached at oleate loading rates up to 0.5 g l-1 day-1. Pulse feeding of oleate (supplementation of 2.0 g oleate l-1 every second day instead of 1.0 g oleate l-1 every day) did not have a substantial impact on the degree of oleate conversion to biogas in the digesters that operated with effluent recirculation, while it marginally enhanced oleate conversion to biogas in the digesters without effluent recirculation. Next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons of bacteria and archaea revealed that pulse feeding resulted in prevalence of fatty acid-degrading Smithella when effluent recirculation was applied, whereas Candidatus Cloacimonas prevailed after pulse feeding of oleate in the digesters without effluent recirculation. Combined oleate pulse feeding and elevated sulfide level contributed to increased relative abundance of LCFA-degrading Syntrophomonas and enhanced conversion efficiency of oleate, but only in the digesters without effluent recirculation.\n\nEffluent solids recirculation improves microbial LCFA degradation capacity, providing possibilities for co-digestion of larger amounts of waste lipids with municipal sludge.",

    "title": "Strong Association of Combined Genetic Deficiencies in the Classical Complement Pathway With Risk of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Primary Sjögren's Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Complete genetic deficiency of the complement component C2 is a strong risk factor for monogenic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but whether heterozygous C2 deficiency adds to the risk of SLE or primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) has not been studied systematically. This study was undertaken to investigate potential associations of heterozygous C2 deficiency and C4 copy number variation with clinical manifestations in patients with SLE and patients with primary SS.\n\nThe presence of the common 28-bp C2 deletion rs9332736 and C4 copy number variation was examined in Scandinavian patients who had received a diagnosis of SLE (n = 958) or primary SS (n = 911) and in 2,262 healthy controls through the use of DNA sequencing. The concentration of complement proteins in plasma and classical complement function were analyzed in a subgroup of SLE patients.\n\nHeterozygous C2 deficiency-when present in combination with a low C4A copy number-substantially increased the risk of SLE (odds ratio [OR] 10.2 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.5-37.0]) and the risk of primary SS (OR 13.0 [95% CI 4.5-48.4]) when compared to individuals with 2 C4A copies and normal C2. For patients heterozygous for rs9332736 with 1 C4A copy, the median age at diagnosis was 7 years earlier in patients with SLE and 12 years earlier in patients with primary SS when compared to patients with normal C2. Reduced C2 levels in plasma (P = 2 × 10-9 ) and impaired function of the classical complement pathway (P = 0.03) were detected in SLE patients with heterozygous C2 deficiency. Finally, in a primary SS patient homozygous for C2 deficiency, we observed low levels of anti-Scl-70, which suggests a risk of developing systemic sclerosis or potential overlap between primary SS and other systemic autoimmune diseases.\n\nWe demonstrate that a genetic pattern involving partial deficiencies of C2 and C4A in the classical complement pathway is a strong risk factor for SLE and for primary SS. Our results emphasize the central role of the complement system in the pathogenesis of both SLE and primary SS.",

    "title": "Expression of human skin-specific genes defined by transcriptomics and antibody-based profiling.",
    "abstract": "To increase our understanding of skin, it is important to define the molecular constituents of the cell types and epidermal layers that signify normal skin. We have combined a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis, using deep sequencing of mRNA from skin biopsies, with immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to characterize the landscape of gene and protein expression in normal human skin. The transcriptomics and protein expression data of skin were compared to 26 (RNA) and 44 (protein) other normal tissue types. All 20,050 putative protein-coding genes were classified into categories based on patterns of expression. We found that 417 genes showed elevated expression in skin, with 106 genes expressed at least five-fold higher than that in other tissues. The 106 genes categorized as skin enriched encoded for well-known proteins involved in epidermal differentiation and proteins with unknown functions and expression patterns in skin, including the C1orf68 protein, which showed the highest relative enrichment in skin. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the human skin-specific proteome and map the precise localization of the corresponding proteins in different compartments of the skin, to facilitate further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal skin and to identify biomarkers related to various skin diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal WNT signaling increases MYC expression in colon cancer cells in part via oncogenic super-enhancer-(OSE)-mediated gating of the active MYC to the nuclear pore in a poorly understood process. We show here that the principal tenet of the WNT-regulated MYC gating, facilitating nuclear export of the MYC mRNA, is regulated by a CTCF binding site (CTCFBS) within the OSE to confer growth advantage in HCT-116 cells. To achieve this, the CTCFBS directs the WNT-dependent trafficking of the OSE to the nuclear pore from intra-nucleoplasmic positions in a stepwise manner. Once the OSE reaches a peripheral position, which is triggered by a CTCFBS-mediated CCAT1 eRNA activation, its final stretch (≤0.7 μm) to the nuclear pore requires the recruitment of AHCTF1, a key nucleoporin, to the CTCFBS. Thus, a WNT/ß-catenin-AHCTF1-CTCF-eRNA circuit enables the OSE to promote pathological cell growth by coordinating the trafficking of the active MYC gene within the 3D nuclear architecture.",

    "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase VI (CA6) catalyses the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in saliva with possible pH regulation, taste perception, and tooth formation effects. This study assessed effects of variation in the CA6 gene on oral microbiota and specifically the acidophilic and caries-associated Streptococcus mutans in 17-year old Swedish adolescents (n = 154). Associations with caries status and secreted CA6 protein were also evaluated. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (27 SNPs in 5 haploblocks) and saliva and tooth biofilm microbiota from Illumina MiSeq 16S rDNA (V3-V4) sequencing and culturing were analysed. Haploblock 4 (rs10864376, rs3737665, rs12138897) CCC associated with low prevalence of S. mutans (OR (95% CI): 0.5 (0.3, 0.8)), and caries (OR 0.6 (0.3, 0.9)), whereas haploblock 4 TTG associated with high prevalence of S. mutans (OR: 2.7 (1.2, 5.9)) and caries (OR: 2.3 (1.2, 4.4)). The TTG-haploblock 4 (represented by rs12138897(G)) was characterized by S. mutans, Scardovia wiggsiae, Treponema sp. HOT268, Tannerella sp. HOT286, Veillonella gp.1 compared with the CCC-haploblock 4 (represented by rs12138897(C)). Secreted CA6 in saliva was weakly linked to CA6 gene variation. In conclusion, the results indicate that CA6 gene polymorphisms influence S. mutans colonization, tooth biofilm microbiota composition and risk of dental caries in Swedish adolescents.",

    "title": "Ionotropic receptors in the turnip moth Agrotis segetum respond to repellent medium-chain fatty acids.",
    "abstract": "In insects, airborne chemical signals are mainly detected by two receptor families, odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs). Functions of ORs have been intensively investigated in Diptera and Lepidoptera, while the functions and evolution of the more ancient IR family remain largely unexplored beyond Diptera.\n\nHere, we identified a repertoire of 26 IRs from transcriptomes of female and male antennae, and ovipositors in the moth Agrotis segetum. We observed that a large clade formed by IR75p and IR75q expansions is closely related to the acid-sensing IRs identified in Diptera. We functionally assayed each of the five AsegIRs from this clade using Xenopus oocytes and found that two receptors responded to the tested ligands. AsegIR75p.1 responded to several compounds but hexanoic acid was revealed to be the primary ligand, and AsegIR75q.1 responded primarily to octanoic acid, and less so to nonanoic acid. It has been reported that the C6-C10 medium-chain fatty acids repel various insects including many drosophilids and mosquitos. We show that the C6-C10 medium-chain fatty acids elicited antennal responses of both sexes of A. segetum, while only octanoic acid had repellent effect to the moths in a behavioral assay. In addition, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that the five IRs and their co-receptor AsegIR8a are not located in coeloconic sensilla as found in Drosophila, but in basiconic or trichoid sensilla.\n\nOur results significantly expand the current knowledge of the insect IR family. Based on the functional data in combination with phylogenetic analysis, we propose that subfunctionalization after gene duplication plays an important role in the evolution of ligand specificities of the acid-sensing IRs in Lepidoptera.",

    "title": "A Multi-Omics Approach to Liver Diseases: Integration of Single Nuclei Transcriptomics with Proteomics and HiCap Bulk Data in Human Liver.",
    "abstract": "The liver is the largest solid organ and a primary metabolic hub. In recent years, intact cell nuclei were used to perform single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) for tissues difficult to dissociate and for flash-frozen archived tissue samples to discover unknown and rare cell subpopulations. In this study, we performed snRNA-seq of a liver sample to identify subpopulations of cells based on nuclear transcriptomics. In 4282 single nuclei, we detected, on average, 1377 active genes and we identified seven major cell types. We integrated data from 94,286 distal interactions (p < 0.05) for 7682 promoters from a targeted chromosome conformation capture technique (HiCap) and mass spectrometry proteomics for the same liver sample. We observed a reasonable correlation between proteomics and in silico bulk snRNA-seq (r = 0.47) using tissue-independent gene-specific protein abundancy estimation factors. We specifically looked at genes of medical importance. The DPYD gene is involved in the pharmacogenetics of fluoropyrimidine toxicity and some of its variants are analyzed for clinical purposes. We identified a new putative polymorphic regulatory element, which may contribute to variation in toxicity. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and we investigated all known risk genes. We identified a complex regulatory landscape for the SLC2A2 gene with 16 candidate enhancers. Three of them harbor somatic motif breaking and other mutations in HCC in the Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes dataset and are candidates to contribute to malignancy. Our results highlight the potential of a multi-omics approach in the study of human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Ecological character displacement is a process of morphological divergence that reduces competition for limited resources. We used genomic analysis to investigate the genetic basis of a documented character displacement event in Darwin's finches on Daphne Major in the Galápagos Islands: The medium ground finch diverged from its competitor, the large ground finch, during a severe drought. We discovered a genomic region containing the HMGA2 gene that varies systematically among Darwin's finch species with different beak sizes. Two haplotypes that diverged early in the radiation were involved in the character displacement event: Genotypes associated with large beak size were at a strong selective disadvantage in medium ground finches (selection coefficient s = 0.59). Thus, a major locus has apparently facilitated a rapid ecological diversification in the adaptive radiation of Darwin's finches.",

    "abstract": "The flexibility of motor actions is ingrained in the diversity of neurons and how they are organized into functional circuit modules, yet our knowledge of the molecular underpinning of motor circuit modularity remains limited. Here we use adult zebrafish to link the molecular diversity of motoneurons (MNs) and the rhythm-generating V2a interneurons (INs) with the modular circuit organization that is responsible for changes in locomotor speed. We show that the molecular diversity of MNs and V2a INs reflects their functional segregation into slow, intermediate or fast subtypes. Furthermore, we reveal shared molecular signatures between V2a INs and MNs of the three speed circuit modules. Overall, by characterizing how the molecular diversity of MNs and V2a INs relates to their function, connectivity and behavior, our study provides important insights not only into the molecular mechanisms for neuronal and circuit diversity for locomotor flexibility but also for charting circuits for motor actions in general.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation, which is modulated by both genetic factors and environmental exposures, may offer a unique opportunity to discover novel biomarkers of disease-related brain phenotypes, even when measured in other tissues than brain, such as blood. A few studies of small sample sizes have revealed associations between blood DNA methylation and neuropsychopathology, however, large-scale epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are needed to investigate the utility of DNA methylation profiling as a peripheral marker for the brain. Here, in an analysis of eleven international cohorts, totalling 3337 individuals, we report epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation with volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-three subcortical regions selected for their associations with disease and heritability and volumetric variability. Analyses of individual CpGs revealed genome-wide significant associations with hippocampal volume at two loci. No significant associations were found for analyses of thalamus and nucleus accumbens volumes. Cluster-based analyses revealed additional differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with hippocampal volume. DNA methylation at these loci affected expression of proximal genes involved in learning and memory, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fatty acid metabolism and type-2 diabetes. These DNA methylation marks, their interaction with genetic variants and their impact on gene expression offer new insights into the relationship between epigenetic variation and brain structure and may provide the basis for biomarker discovery in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "title": "High-Resolution Mapping of Crossover and Non-crossover Recombination Events by Whole-Genome Re-sequencing of an Avian Pedigree.",
    "abstract": "Recombination is an engine of genetic diversity and therefore constitutes a key process in evolutionary biology and genetics. While the outcome of crossover recombination can readily be detected as shuffled alleles by following the inheritance of markers in pedigreed families, the more precise location of both crossover and non-crossover recombination events has been difficult to pinpoint. As a consequence, we lack a detailed portrait of the recombination landscape for most organisms and knowledge on how this landscape impacts on sequence evolution at a local scale. To localize recombination events with high resolution in an avian system, we performed whole-genome re-sequencing at high coverage of a complete three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree. We identified 325 crossovers at a median resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86% of the events localized to <10 kb intervals. Observed crossover rates were in excellent agreement with data from linkage mapping, were 52% higher in male (3.56 cM/Mb) than in female meiosis (2.28 cM/Mb), and increased towards chromosome ends in male but not female meiosis. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome with several distinct hot-spots and a concentration to genic regions, with the highest density in promoters and CpG islands. We further identified 267 non-crossovers, whose location was significantly associated with crossover locations. We detected a significant transmission bias (0.18) in favour of 'strong' (G, C) over 'weak' (A, T) alleles at non-crossover events, providing direct evidence for the process of GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system. The approach taken in this study should be applicable to any species and would thereby help to provide a more comprehensive portray of the recombination landscape across organism groups.",

    "title": "Genome Variation in Three Anthophora Bee Species Reflects Divergent Demographic Histories",
    "abstract": "Population genomics can reveal trends and drivers of biodiversity loss, but it is still unclear how best to use measures of genome variation to understand population vulnerability in insects. Here we study genome variation in three species of Anthophora bees that show contrasting population trends in northern Europe. Two species, Anthophora plagiata and Anthophora retusa , have experienced declines and recoveries of different magnitudes in the last 50 years, whereas a third species, Anthophora quadrimaculata , has relative population stability. We generate highly contiguous genome assemblies and use them to study genome variation in 136 samples of these species collected throughout Sweden. We find exceedingly low genetic variation in A. plagiata , which has experienced a severe recent bottleneck, but high genetic variation in A. retusa , despite a similar recent population trajectory. Fragmented populations of the threatened species A. plagiata appear isolated from each other, but in A. retusa, there is a lack of deep population structure among geographically separated subpopulations. We infer population size in the distant past using MSMC2 and recent past using GONE. These methods are remarkably concordant and indicate ancient fluctuations in population size dating back to the Pleistocene, with moderate expansions in the past century in all three species. These results are comparable to some other studies of endangered insects, which have experienced population declines that predate the modern era. We detect long blocks of identity-by-state in A. plagiata , indicative of severe recent inbreeding. Translocations between isolated populations of this species could have a positive effect on their resilience.",

    "title": "Convergent Evolution of Hydrogenosomes from Mitochondria by Gene Transfer and Loss.",
    "abstract": "Hydrogenosomes are H2-producing mitochondrial homologs found in some anaerobic microbial eukaryotes that provide a rare intracellular niche for H2-utilizing endosymbiotic archaea. Among ciliates, anaerobic and aerobic lineages are interspersed, demonstrating that the switch to an anaerobic lifestyle with hydrogenosomes has occurred repeatedly and independently. To investigate the molecular details of this transition, we generated genomic and transcriptomic data sets from anaerobic ciliates representing three distinct lineages. Our data demonstrate that hydrogenosomes have evolved from ancestral mitochondria in each case and reveal different degrees of independent mitochondrial genome and proteome reductive evolution, including the first example of complete mitochondrial genome loss in ciliates. Intriguingly, the FeFe-hydrogenase used for generating H2 has a unique domain structure among eukaryotes and appears to have been present, potentially through a single lateral gene transfer from an unknown donor, in the common aerobic ancestor of all three lineages. The early acquisition and retention of FeFe-hydrogenase helps to explain the facility whereby mitochondrial function can be so radically modified within this diverse and ecologically important group of microbial eukaryotes.",
