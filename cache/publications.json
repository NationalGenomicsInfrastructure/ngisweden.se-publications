    "abstract": "Biooxidation of gold-bearing refractory mineral ores such as arsenopyrite (FeAsS) in stirred tanks produces solutions containing highly toxic arsenic concentrations. In this study, ferrous iron and inorganic sulfur-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus strain IBUN Ppt12 most similar to Acidithiobacillus ferrianus and inorganic sulfur compound oxidizing Acidithiobacillus sp. IBUNS3 were grown in co-culture during biooxidation of refractory FeAsS. Total RNA was extracted and sequenced from the planktonic cells to reveal genes with different transcript counts involved in the response to FeAsS containing medium. The co-culture's response to arsenic release during biooxidation included the ars operon genes that were independently regulated according to the arsenopyrite concentration. Additionally, increased mRNA transcript counts were identified for transmembrane ion transport proteins, stress response mechanisms, accumulation of inorganic polyphosphates, urea catabolic processes, and tryptophan biosynthesis. Acidithiobacillus spp. RNA transcripts also included those encoding the Rus and PetI proteins involved in ferrous iron oxidation and gene clusters annotated as encoding inorganic sulfur compound metabolism enzymes. Finally, mRNA counts of genes related to DNA methylation, management of oxidative stress, chemotaxis, and motility during biooxidation were decreased compared to cells growing without mineral. The results provide insights into the adaptation of Acidithiobacillus spp. to growth during biooxidation of arsenic-bearing sulfides.",

    "title": "Profiling spatiotemporal gene expression of the developing human spinal cord and implications for ependymoma origin.",
    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal regulation of cell fate specification in the human developing spinal cord remains largely unknown. In this study, by performing integrated analysis of single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, we used 16 prenatal human samples to create a comprehensive developmental cell atlas of the spinal cord during post-conceptional weeks 5-12. This revealed how the cell fate commitment of neural progenitor cells and their spatial positioning are spatiotemporally regulated by specific gene sets. We identified unique events in human spinal cord development relative to rodents, including earlier quiescence of active neural stem cells, differential regulation of cell differentiation and distinct spatiotemporal genetic regulation of cell fate choices. In addition, by integrating our atlas with pediatric ependymomas data, we identified specific molecular signatures and lineage-specific genes of cancer stem cells during progression. Thus, we delineate spatiotemporal genetic regulation of human spinal cord development and leverage these data to gain disease insight.",

    "abstract": "Following implantation, the epiblast (EPI) cells transit from the naive to primed pluripotency, accompanied by dynamic changes in X chromosome activity in females. To investigate the molecular attributes of this process, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 1,724 cells of E5.25, E5.5, E6.25, and E6.5 mouse embryos. We identified three cellular states in the EPI cells that capture the transition along the pluripotency continuum and the acquisition of primitive streak propensity. The transition of three EPI states was driven by inductive signaling activity emanating from the visceral endoderm (VE). In the EPI of female embryos, X chromosome reactivation (XCR) was initiated prior to the completion of imprinted X chromosome inactivation (XCI), and the ensuing random XCI was highly asynchronous. Moreover, imprinted paternal XCI proceeded faster in the VE than the extraembryonic ectoderm. Our study has provided a detailed molecular roadmap of the emergent lineage commitment before gastrulation and characterized X chromosome dynamics during early mouse development.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to investigate the associations of genetically predicted serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25OHD), calcium (S-Ca), and parathyroid hormone (S-PTH) levels with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).\n\nSeven, six, and five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with S-25OHD, S-Ca, and S-PTH levels, respectively, were used as instrumental variables. Data on T2DM were available for 74,124 case subjects with T2DM and 824,006 control subjects. The inverse variance-weighted method was used for the primary analyses, and the weighted median and Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger methods were used for supplementary analyses.\n\nGenetically predicted S-25OHD but not S-Ca and S-PTH levels were associated with T2DM in the primary analyses. For 1 SD increment of S-25OHD levels, the odds ratio (OR) of T2DM was 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-0.99; P = 0.029) in an analysis based on all seven SNPs and 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.98; P = 0.011) in an analysis based on three SNPs within or near genes involved in vitamin D synthesis. Only the association based on the SNPs involved in vitamin D synthesis remained in the weighted median analysis, and no pleiotropy was detected (P = 0.153). Pleiotropy was detected in the analysis of S-Ca (P = 0.013). After correcting for this bias using MR-Egger regression, the OR of T2DM per 1 SD increment of S-Ca levels was 1.41 (95% CI 1.12-1.77; P = 0.003).\n\nModest lifelong higher S-25OHD levels were associated with reduced odds of T2DM, but the association was only robust for SNPs in the vitamin D synthesis pathway. The possible role of S-Ca levels for T2DM development requires further research.",

    "title": "Gene expression profiling across ontogenetic stages in the wood white (Leptidea sinapis) reveals pathways linked to butterfly diapause regulation.",
    "abstract": "In temperate latitudes, many insects enter diapause (dormancy) during the cold season, a period during which developmental processes come to a standstill. The wood white (Leptidea sinapis) is a butterfly species distributed across western Eurasia that shows photoperiod-induced diapause with variation in critical day-length across populations at different latitudes. We assembled transcriptomes and estimated gene expression levels at different developmental stages in experimentally induced directly developing and diapausing cohorts of a single Swedish population of L. sinapis to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underpinning diapause initiation. Different day lengths resulted in expression changes of developmental genes and affected the rate of accumulation of signal molecules, suggesting that diapause induction might be controlled by increased activity of monoamine neurotransmitters in larvae reared under short-day light conditions. Expression differences between light treatment groups of two monoamine regulator genes (DDC and ST) were observed already in instar III larvae. Once developmental pathways were irreversibly set at instar V, a handful of genes related to dopamine production were differentially expressed leading to a significant decrease in expression of global metabolic genes and increase in expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis and sequestration. This is in line with a time-dependent (hour-glass) model of diapause regulation where a gradual shift in the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites during development of larvae under short-day conditions leads to increased storage of fat, decreased energy expenditures, and ultimately developmental stasis at the pupal stage.",

    "title": "Predicting type 2 diabetes via machine learning integration of multiple omics from human pancreatic islets.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the fastest growing non-infectious disease worldwide. Impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells is a hallmark of T2D, but the mechanisms behind this defect are insufficiently characterized. Integrating multiple layers of biomedical information, such as different Omics, may allow more accurate understanding of complex diseases such as T2D. Our aim was to explore and use Machine Learning to integrate multiple sources of biological/molecular information (multiOmics), in our case RNA-sequening, DNA methylation, SNP and phenotypic data from islet donors with T2D and non-diabetic controls. We exploited Machine Learning to perform multiOmics integration of DNA methylation, expression, SNPs, and phenotypes from pancreatic islets of 110 individuals, with ~ 30% being T2D cases. DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium MethylationEPIC array, expression was analyzed using RNA-sequencing, and SNPs were analyzed using HumanOmniExpress arrays. Supervised linear multiOmics integration via DIABLO based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) achieved an accuracy of 91 ± 15% of T2D prediction with an area under the curve of 0.96 ± 0.08 on the test dataset after cross-validation. Biomarkers identified by this multiOmics integration, including SACS and TXNIP DNA methylation, OPRD1 and RHOT1 expression and a SNP annotated to ANO1, provide novel insights into the interplay between different biological mechanisms contributing to T2D. This Machine Learning approach of multiOmics cross-sectional data from human pancreatic islets achieved a promising accuracy of T2D prediction, which may potentially find broad applications in clinical diagnostics. In addition, it delivered novel candidate biomarkers for T2D and links between them across the different Omics.",

    "title": "Transcriptome Analysis of Post-Mortem Brain Tissue Reveals Up-Regulation of the Complement Cascade in a Subgroup of Schizophrenia Patients.",
    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorder with largely unresolved mechanisms of pathology. Identification of genes and pathways associated with schizophrenia is important for understanding the development, progression and treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, pathways associated with schizophrenia were explored at the level of gene expression. The study included post-mortem brain tissue samples from 68 schizophrenia patients and 44 age and sex-matched control subjects. Whole transcriptome poly-A selected paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on tissue from the prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. RNA expression differences were detected between case and control individuals, focusing both on single genes and pathways. The results were validated with RT-qPCR. Significant differential expression between patient and controls groups was found for 71 genes. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed an up-regulation of multiple genes in immune response among the patients (corrected p-value = 0.004). Several genes in the category belong to the complement system, including C1R, C1S, C7, FCN3, SERPING1, C4A and CFI. The increased complement expression is primarily driven by a subgroup of patients with increased expression of immune/inflammatory response genes, pointing to important differences in disease etiology within the patient group. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis highlighted networks associated with both synaptic transmission and activation of the immune response. Our results demonstrate the importance of immune-related pathways in schizophrenia and provide evidence for elevated expression of the complement cascade as an important pathway in schizophrenia pathology.",

    "abstract": "Microbial ecology as a scientific field is fundamentally driven by technological advance. The past decade's revolution in DNA sequencing cost and throughput has made it possible for most research groups to map microbial community composition in environments of interest. However, the computational and statistical methodology required to analyse this kind of data is often not part of the biologist training. In this review, we give a historical perspective on the use of sequencing data in microbial ecology and restate the current need for this method; but also highlight the major caveats with standard practices for handling these data, from sample collection and library preparation to statistical analysis. Further, we outline the main new analytical tools that have been developed in the past few years to bypass these caveats, as well as highlight the major requirements of common statistical practices and the extent to which they are applicable to microbial data. Besides delving into the meaning of select alpha- and beta-diversity measures, we give special consideration to techniques for finding the main drivers of community dissimilarity and for interaction network construction. While every project design has specific needs, this review should serve as a starting point for considering what options are available.",

    "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the presence of intracellular protein aggregates, resulting in alterations in autophagy. However, the consequences of impaired autophagy for neuronal function remain poorly understood. In this study, we used cell culture and mouse models of huntingtin protein aggregation as well as post-mortem material from patients with Huntington's disease to demonstrate that Argonaute-2 (AGO2) accumulates in the presence of neuronal protein aggregates and that this is due to impaired autophagy. Accumulation of AGO2, a key factor of the RNA-induced silencing complex that executes microRNA functions, results in global alterations of microRNA levels and activity. Together, these results demonstrate that impaired autophagy found in neurodegenerative diseases not only influences protein aggregation but also directly contributes to global alterations of intracellular post-transcriptional networks.",

    "title": "Epigenomic priming of immune genes implicates oligodendroglia in multiple sclerosis susceptibility.",
    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a targeted attack on oligodendroglia (OLG) and myelin by immune cells, which are thought to be the main drivers of MS susceptibility. We found that immune genes exhibit a primed chromatin state in single mouse and human OLG in a non-disease context, compatible with transitions to immune-competent states in MS. We identified BACH1 and STAT1 as transcription factors involved in immune gene regulation in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). A subset of immune genes presents bivalency of H3K4me3/H3K27me3 in OPCs, with Polycomb inhibition leading to their increased activation upon interferon gamma (IFN-γ) treatment. Some MS susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) overlap with these regulatory regions in mouse and human OLG. Treatment of mouse OPCs with IFN-γ leads to chromatin architecture remodeling at these loci and altered expression of interacting genes. Thus, the susceptibility for MS may involve OLG, which therefore constitutes novel targets for immunological-based therapies for MS.",

    "abstract": "New generation sequencing technologies producing increasingly complex datasets demand new efficient and specialized sequence analysis algorithms. Often, it is only the 'novel' sequences in a complex dataset that are of interest and the superfluous sequences need to be removed.\n\nA novel algorithm, fast and accurate classification of sequences (FACSs), is introduced that can accurately and rapidly classify sequences as belonging or not belonging to a reference sequence. FACS was first optimized and validated using a synthetic metagenome dataset. An experimental metagenome dataset was then used to show that FACS achieves comparable accuracy as BLAT and SSAHA2 but is at least 21 times faster in classifying sequences.\n\nSource code for FACS, Bloom filters and MetaSim dataset used is available at http://facs.biotech.kth.se.

    "title": "Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes: captivity changes the gut microbiota composition and diversity in a social subterranean rodent.",
    "abstract": "In mammals, the gut microbiota has important effects on the health of their hosts. Recent research highlights that animal populations that live in captivity often differ in microbiota diversity and composition from wild populations. However, the changes that may occur when animals move to captivity remain difficult to predict and factors generating such differences are poorly understood. Here we compare the bacterial gut microbiota of wild and captive Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) originating from a population in the southern Kalahari Desert to characterise the changes of the gut microbiota that occur from one generation to the next generation in a long-lived, social rodent species.\n\nWe found a clear divergence in the composition of the gut microbiota of captive and wild Damaraland mole-rats. Although the dominating higher-rank bacterial taxa were the same in the two groups, captive animals had an increased ratio of relative abundance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes compared to wild animals. The Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) that were strongly associated with wild animals were commonly members of the same bacterial families as those strongly associated with captive animals. Captive animals had much higher ASV richness compared to wild-caught animals, explained by an increased richness within the Firmicutes.\n\nWe found that the gut microbiota of captive hosts differs substantially from the gut microbiota composition of wild hosts. The largest differences between the two groups were found in shifts in relative abundances and diversity of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.",

    "title": "A common polymorphism in the dopamine transporter gene predicts working memory performance and in vivo dopamine integrity in aging.",
    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) integrity is suggested as a potential cause of individual differences in working memory (WM) performance among older adults. Still, the principal dopaminergic mechanisms giving rise to WM differences remain unspecified. Here, 61 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, located in or adjacent to various dopamine-related genes, were assessed for their links to WM performance in a sample of 1313 adults aged 61-80 years from the Berlin Aging Study II. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was conducted to estimate associations between polymorphisms and WM. Rs40184 in the DA transporter gene, SLC6A3, showed allelic group differences in WM, with T-carriers performing better than C homozygotes (p<0.01). This finding was replicated in an independent sample from the Cognition, Brain, and Aging study (COBRA; baseline: n = 181, ages: 64-68 years; 5-year follow up: n = 129). In COBRA, in vivo DA integrity was measured with 11C-raclopride and positron emission tomography. Notably, WM as well as in vivo DA integrity was higher for rs40184 T-carriers at baseline (p<0.05 for WM and caudate and hippocampal D2-receptor availability) and at the 5-year follow-up (p<0.05 for WM and hippocampal D2 availability). Our findings indicate that individual differences in DA transporter function contribute to differences in WM performance in old age, presumably by regulating DA availability.",

    "title": "Development and Optimization of a Silica Column-Based Extraction Protocol for Ancient DNA.",
    "abstract": "Rapid and cost-effective retrieval of endogenous DNA from ancient specimens remains a limiting factor in palaeogenomic research. Many methods have been developed to increase ancient DNA yield, but modifications to existing protocols are often based on personal experience rather than systematic testing. Here, we present a new silica column-based extraction protocol, where optimizations were tested in controlled experiments. Using relatively well-preserved permafrost samples, we tested the efficiency of pretreatment of bone and tooth powder with a bleach wash and a predigestion step. We also tested the recovery efficiency of MinElute and QIAquick columns, as well as Vivaspin columns with two molecular weight cut-off values. Finally, we tested the effect of uracil-treatment with two different USER enzyme concentrations. We find that neither bleach wash combined with a predigestion step, nor predigestion by itself, significantly increased sequencing efficiency. Initial results, however, suggest that MinElute columns are more efficient for ancient DNA extractions than QIAquick columns, whereas different molecular weight cut-off values in centrifugal concentrator columns did not have an effect. Uracil treatments are effective at removing DNA damage even at concentrations of 0.15 U/µL (as compared to 0.3 U/µL) of ancient DNA extracts.",

    "title": "Nitrogen Removal Capacity of Microbial Communities Developing in Compost- and Woodchip-Based Multipurpose Reactive Barriers for Aquifer Recharge With Wastewater.",
    "abstract": "Global water supplies are threatened by climate changes and the expansion of urban areas, which have led to an increasing interest in nature-based solutions for water reuse and reclamation. Reclaimed water is a possible resource for recharging aquifers, and the addition of an organic reactive barrier has been proposed to improve the removal of pollutants. There has been a large focus on organic pollutants, but less is known about multifunctional barriers, that is, how barriers also remove nutrients that threaten groundwater ecosystems. Herein, we investigated how compost- and woodchip-based barriers affect nitrogen (N) removal in a pilot soil aquifer treatment facility designed for removing nutrients and recalcitrant compounds by investigating the composition of microbial communities and their capacity for N transformations. Secondary-treated, ammonium-rich wastewater was infiltrated through the barriers, and the changes in the concentration of ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured after passage through the barrier during 1 year of operation. The development and composition of the microbial community in the barriers were examined, and potential N-transforming processes in the barriers were quantified by determining the abundance of key functional genes using quantitative PCR. Only one barrier, based on compost, significantly decreased the ammonium concentration in the infiltrated water. However, the reduction of reactive N in the barriers was moderate (between 21 and 37%), and there were no differences between the barrier types. All the barriers were after 1 year dominated by members of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, although the community composition differed between the barriers. Bacterial classes belonging to the phylum Chloroflexi showed an increased relative abundance in the compost-based barriers. In contrast to the increased genetic potential for nitrification in the compost-based barriers, the woodchip-based barrier demonstrated higher genetic potentials for denitrification, nitrous oxide reduction, and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium. The barriers have previously been shown to display a high capacity to degrade recalcitrant pollutants, but in this study, we show that most barriers performed poorly in terms of N removal and those based on compost also leaked DOC, highlighting the difficulties in designing barriers that satisfactorily meet several purposes.",

    "abstract": "The bacterium Escherichia coli is the most widely used expression host for overexpression trials of membrane proteins. Usually, different strains, culture conditions and expression regimes are screened for to identify the optimal overexpression strategy. However, yields are often not satisfactory, especially for eukaryotic membrane proteins. This has initiated a revolution of membrane protein overexpression in bacteria. Recent studies have shown that it is feasible to (i) engineer or select for E. coli strains with strongly improved membrane protein overexpression characteristics, (ii) use bacteria other than E. coli for the expression of membrane proteins, (iii) engineer or select for membrane protein variants that retain functionality but express better than the wild-type protein, and (iv) express membrane proteins using E. coli-based cell-free systems.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a peripheral neural system tumor that originates from the neural crest and is the most common and deadly tumor of infancy. Here we show that neuroblastoma harbors frequent mutations of genes controlling the Rac/Rho signaling cascade important for proper migration and differentiation of neural crest cells during neuritogenesis. RhoA is activated in tumors from neuroblastoma patients, and elevated expression of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)2 is associated with poor patient survival. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ROCK1 and 2, key molecules in Rho signaling, resulted in neuroblastoma cell differentiation and inhibition of neuroblastoma cell growth, migration, and invasion. Molecularly, ROCK inhibition induced glycogen synthase kinase 3β-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of MYCN protein. Small-molecule inhibition of ROCK suppressed MYCN-driven neuroblastoma growth in TH-MYCN homozygous transgenic mice and MYCN gene-amplified neuroblastoma xenograft growth in nude mice. Interference with Rho/Rac signaling might offer therapeutic perspectives for high-risk neuroblastoma.",

    "title": "Transcriptomics and methylomics of CD4-positive T cells in arsenic-exposed women.",
    "abstract": "Arsenic, a carcinogen with immunotoxic effects, is a common contaminant of drinking water and certain food worldwide. We hypothesized that chronic arsenic exposure alters gene expression, potentially by altering DNA methylation of genes encoding central components of the immune system. We therefore analyzed the transcriptomes (by RNA sequencing) and methylomes (by target-enrichment next-generation sequencing) of primary CD4-positive T cells from matched groups of four women each in the Argentinean Andes, with fivefold differences in urinary arsenic concentrations (median concentrations of urinary arsenic in the lower- and high-arsenic groups: 65 and 276 μg/l, respectively). Arsenic exposure was associated with genome-wide alterations of gene expression; principal component analysis indicated that the exposure explained 53% of the variance in gene expression among the top variable genes and 19% of 28,351 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05) between the exposure groups. Key genes regulating the immune system, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, as well as genes related to the NF-kappa-beta complex, were significantly downregulated in the high-arsenic group. Arsenic exposure was associated with genome-wide DNA methylation; the high-arsenic group had 3% points higher genome-wide full methylation (>80% methylation) than the lower-arsenic group. Differentially methylated regions that were hyper-methylated in the high-arsenic group showed enrichment for immune-related gene ontologies that constitute the basic functions of CD4-positive T cells, such as isotype switching and lymphocyte activation and differentiation. In conclusion, chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water was related to changes in the transcriptome and methylome of CD4-positive T cells, both genome wide and in specific genes, supporting the hypothesis that arsenic causes immunotoxicity by interfering with gene expression and regulation.",

These samples are frequently only available in limited quantities hampering genomic analysis. Several whole genome amplification (WGA) protocols have been developed with reported varying representation of genomic regions post amplification. In this study we investigate region dropout using a φ29 polymerase based WGA approach. DNA from 123 lung cancers specimens and corresponding normal tissue were used and evaluated by Sanger sequencing of the p53 exons 5-8. To enable comparative analysis of this scarce material, WGA samples were compared with unamplified material using a pooling strategy of the 123 samples. In addition, a more detailed analysis of exon 7 amplicons were performed followed by extensive cloning and Sanger sequencing. Interestingly, by comparing data from the pooled samples to the individually sequenced exon 7, we demonstrate that mutations are more easily recovered from WGA pools and this was also supported by simulations of different sequencing coverage. Overall this data indicate a limited random loss of genomic regions supporting the use of whole genome amplification for genomic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Scandinavia was one of the last geographic areas in Europe to become habitable for humans after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, the routes and genetic composition of these postglacial migrants remain unclear. We sequenced the genomes, up to 57× coverage, of seven hunter-gatherers excavated across Scandinavia and dated from 9,500-6,000 years before present (BP). Surprisingly, among the Scandinavian Mesolithic individuals, the genetic data display an east-west genetic gradient that opposes the pattern seen in other parts of Mesolithic Europe. Our results suggest two different early postglacial migrations into Scandinavia: initially from the south, and later, from the northeast. The latter followed the ice-free Norwegian north Atlantic coast, along which novel and advanced pressure-blade stone-tool techniques may have spread. These two groups met and mixed in Scandinavia, creating a genetically diverse population, which shows patterns of genetic adaptation to high latitude environments. These potential adaptations include high frequencies of low pigmentation variants and a gene region associated with physical performance, which shows strong continuity into modern-day northern Europeans.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular small RNAs (sRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), are promising biomarkers for diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), although their biological relevance is largely unknown. To investigate the relationship between intracellular and extracellular sRNA levels on a global scale, we performed sRNA sequencing in four muscle types and serum from wild-type, dystrophic mdx, and mdx mice in which dystrophin protein expression was restored by exon skipping. Differentially abundant sRNAs were identified in serum (mapping to miRNA, small nuclear RNA [snRNA], and PIWI-interacting RNA [piRNA] loci). One novel candidate biomarker, miR-483, was increased in both mdx serum and muscle, and also elevated in DMD patient sera. Dystrophin restoration induced global shifts in miRNA (including miR-483) and snRNA-fragment abundance toward wild-type levels. Specific serum piRNA-like sRNAs also responded to exon skipping therapy. Absolute miRNA expression in muscle was positively correlated with abundance in the circulation, although multiple highly expressed miRNAs in muscle were not elevated in mdx serum, suggesting that both passive and selective release mechanisms contribute to serum miRNA levels. In conclusion, this study has revealed new insights into the sRNA biology of dystrophin deficiency and identified novel DMD biomarkers.",

    "title": "Orthopteran Neo-Sex Chromosomes Reveal Dynamics of Recombination Suppression and Evolution of Supergenes.",
    "abstract": "The early evolution of sex chromosomes has remained obscure for more than a century. The Vandiemenella viatica species group of morabine grasshoppers is highly suited for studying the early stages of sex chromosome divergence and degeneration of the Y chromosome. This stems from the fact that neo-XY sex chromosomes have independently evolved multiple times by X-autosome fusions with different autosomes. Here, we generated new chromosome-level assemblies for two chromosomal races representing karyotypes with and without neo-sex chromosomes (P24XY and P24X0), and sequence data of a third chromosomal race with a different neo-XY chromosome system (P25XY). Interestingly, these two neo-XY chromosomal races are formed by different X-autosome fusions (involving chr1 and chrB, respectively), and we found that both neo-Y chromosomes have partly ceased to recombine with their neo-X counterpart. We show that the neo-XY chromosomes have diverged through accumulation of SNPs and structural mutations, and that many neo-Y-linked genes have degenerated since recombination ceased. However, the non-recombining regions of neo-Y chromosomes host non-degenerated genes crucial for sex determination, such as sex-lethal and transformer, alongside genes associated with spermatogenesis, fertility, and reproduction, illustrating their integrative role as a masculinizing supergene. Contrary to expectations, the neo-Y chromosomes showed (slightly) lower density of transposable elements (TEs) compared to other genomic regions. The study reveals the unique dynamics of young sex chromosomes, with evolution of recombination suppression and pronounced decay of (some) neo-sex chromosome genes, and provides a compelling case illustrating how chromosomal fusions and post-fusion mutational processes contribute to the evolution of supergenes.",

    "title": "Evaluation of genetic demultiplexing of single-cell sequencing data from model species.",
    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (sc-seq) provides a species agnostic tool to study cellular processes. However, these technologies are expensive and require sufficient cell quantities and biological replicates to avoid artifactual results. An option to address these problems is pooling cells from multiple individuals into one sc-seq library. In humans, genotype-based computational separation (i.e., demultiplexing) of pooled sc-seq samples is common. This approach would be instrumental for studying non-isogenic model organisms. We set out to determine whether genotype-based demultiplexing could be more broadly applied among species ranging from zebrafish to non-human primates. Using such non-isogenic species, we benchmark genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq datasets against various ground truths. We demonstrate that genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq samples can be used with confidence in several non-isogenic model organisms and uncover limitations of this method. Importantly, the only genomic resource required for this approach is sc-seq data and a de novo transcriptome. The incorporation of pooling into sc-seq study designs will decrease cost while simultaneously increasing the reproducibility and experimental options in non-isogenic model organisms.",

    "abstract": "For millennia, the Pontic-Caspian steppe was a connector between the Eurasian steppe and Europe. In this scene, multidirectional and sequential movements of different populations may have occurred, including those of the Eurasian steppe nomads. We sequenced 35 genomes (low to medium coverage) of Bronze Age individuals (Srubnaya-Alakulskaya) and Iron Age nomads (Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians) that represent four distinct cultural entities corresponding to the chronological sequence of cultural complexes in the region. Our results suggest that, despite genetic links among these peoples, no group can be considered a direct ancestor of the subsequent group. The nomadic populations were heterogeneous and carried genetic affinities with populations from several other regions including the Far East and the southern Urals. We found evidence of a stable shared genetic signature, making the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe a likely source of western nomadic groups.",

    "title": "Proteomic and transcriptomic screening demonstrates increased mast cell-derived CCL23 in systemic mastocytosis.",
    "abstract": "Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a heterogeneous group of mast cell-driven diseases diagnosed by bone marrow sampling. However, there are a limited number of available blood disease biomarkers.\n\nOur aim was to identify mast cell-derived proteins that could potentially serve as blood biomarkers for indolent and advanced forms of SM.\n\nWe performed a plasma proteomics screening coupled with single-cell transcriptomic analysis in SM patients and healthy subjects.\n\nPlasma proteomics screening identified 19 proteins upregulated in indolent disease compared to healthy, and 16 proteins in advanced disease compared to indolent. Among these, 5 proteins, CCL19, CCL23, CXCL13, IL-10, and IL-12Rβ1, were higher in indolent relative to healthy and in advanced disease compared to indolent. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that CCL23, IL-10, and IL-6 were selectively produced by mast cells. Notably, plasma CCL23 levels correlated positively with known markers of SM disease severity, namely tryptase levels, percentage bone marrow mast cell infiltration, and IL-6.\n\nCCL23 is produced predominantly by mast cells in SM, and CCL23 plasma levels are associated with disease severity, correlating positively with established markers of disease burden, thus suggesting that CCL23 is a specific SM biomarker. In addition, the combination of CCL19, CCL23, CXCL13, IL-10, and IL-12Rβ1 may be useful for defining disease stage.",

    "title": "Insights into the multitrophic interactions between the biocontrol agent Bacillus subtilis MBI 600, the pathogen Botrytis cinerea and their plant host.",
    "abstract": "Botrytis cinerea is a plant pathogen causing the gray mold disease in a plethora of host plants. The control of the disease is based mostly on chemical pesticides, which are responsible for environmental pollution, while they also pose risks for human health. Furthermore, B. cinerea resistant isolates have been identified against many fungicide groups, making the control of this disease challenging. The application of biocontrol agents can be a possible solution, but requires deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms in order to be effective. In this study, we investigated the multitrophic interactions between the biocontrol agent Bacillus subtilis MBI 600, a new commercialized biopesticide, the pathogen B. cinerea and their plant host. Our analysis showed that this biocontrol agent reduced B. cinerea mycelial growth in vitro, and was able to suppress the disease incidence on cucumber plants. Moreover, treatment with B. subtilis led to induction of genes involved in plant immunity. RNA-seq analysis of B. cinerea transcriptome upon exposure to bacterial secretome, showed that genes coding for MFS and ABC transporters were highly induced. Deletion of the Bcmfs1 MFS transporter gene, using a CRISP/Cas9 editing method, affected its virulence and the tolerance of B. cinerea to bacterial secondary metabolites. These findings suggest that specific detoxification transporters are involved in these interactions, with crucial role in different aspects of B. cinerea physiology.",

    "title": "Discovery of the fourth mobile sulfonamide resistance gene.",
    "abstract": "Over the past 75 years, human pathogens have acquired antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), often from environmental bacteria. Integrons play a major role in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. We therefore hypothesized that focused exploration of integron gene cassettes from microbial communities could be an efficient way to find novel mobile resistance genes. DNA from polluted Indian river sediments were amplified using three sets of primers targeting class 1 integrons and sequenced by long- and short-read technologies to maintain both accuracy and context.\n\nUp to 89% of identified open reading frames encode known resistance genes, or variations thereof (> 1000). We identified putative novel ARGs to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, trimethoprim, rifampicin, and chloramphenicol, including several novel OXA variants, providing reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. One dihydropteroate synthase gene, with less than 34% amino acid identity to the three known mobile sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1-3), provided complete resistance when expressed in Escherichia coli. The mobilized gene, here named sul4, is the first mobile sulfonamide resistance gene discovered since 2003. Analyses of adjacent DNA suggest that sul4 has been decontextualized from a set of chromosomal genes involved in folate synthesis in its original host, likely within the phylum Chloroflexi. The presence of an insertion sequence common region element could provide mobility to the entire integron. Screening of 6489 metagenomic datasets revealed that sul4 is already widespread in seven countries across Asia and Europe.\n\nOur findings show that exploring integrons from environmental communities with a history of antibiotic exposure can provide an efficient way to find novel, mobile resistance genes. The mobilization of a fourth sulfonamide resistance gene is likely to provide expanded opportunities for sulfonamide resistance to spread, with potential impacts on both human and animal health.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain remains a significant medical challenge with complex underlying mechanisms, and an urgent need for new treatments. Our research built and utilized the iPain single-cell atlas to study chronic pain progression in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. We discovered that senescence of a small subset of pain-sensing neurons may be a driver of chronic pain. This mechanism was observed in animal models after nerve injury and in human patients diagnosed with chronic pain or diabetic painful neuropathy. Notably, treatment with senolytics, drugs that remove senescent cells, reversed pain symptoms in mice post-injury. These findings highlight the role of cellular senescence in chronic pain development, demonstrate the therapeutic potential of senolytic treatments, and underscore the value of the iPain atlas for future pain research.",

    "title": "Signaling pathways involved in the regulation of TNFα-induced toll-like receptor 2 expression in human gingival fibroblasts.",
    "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a host inflammatory response against bacteria that leads to destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. Bacterial components of pathogens in the periodontal pocket are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that trigger an inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) on TLR2 expression in human gingival fibroblasts. In addition, we examined the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of TNFα-induced TLR2 expression. Our results showed that TNFα increased TLR2 mRNA and protein expression. Microarray analysis and the inhibition of specific signaling pathways demonstrated that c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were involved in the regulation of TNFα-induced TLR2 expression in gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, the prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) regulatory enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and the anti-inflammatory prostaglandin 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), were found to regulate TLR2 mRNA expression stimulated by TNFα. Our findings suggest that these pathways and mediators, through the regulation of TLR2 expression in gingival fibroblasts, may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of TLR2, implicated in the chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "We here present a comparative genome, transcriptome and functional network analysis of three human cancer cell lines (A431, U251MG and U2OS), and investigate their relation to protein expression. Gene copy numbers significantly influenced corresponding transcript levels; their effect on protein levels was less pronounced. We focused on genes with altered mRNA and/or protein levels to identify those active in tumor maintenance. We provide comprehensive information for the three genomes and demonstrate the advantage of integrative analysis for identifying tumor-related genes amidst numerous background mutations by relating genomic variation to expression/protein abundance data and use gene networks to reveal implicated pathways.",

    "title": "Influence of cysteine, serine, sulfate, and sulfide on anaerobic conversion of unsaturated long-chain fatty acid, oleate, to methane.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to elucidate the role of sulfide and its precursors in anaerobic digestion (i.e., cysteine, representing sulfur-containing amino acids, and sulfate) on microbial oleate conversion to methane. Serine, with a similar structure to cysteine but with a hydroxyl group instead of a thiol, was included as a control to assess potential effects on methane formation that were not related to sulfur functionalities. The results showed that copresence of sulfide and oleate in anaerobic batch assays accelerated the methane formation compared to assays with only oleate and mitigated negative effect on methane formation caused by increased sulfide level. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of sulfide-exposed oleate suggested that sulfide reaction with oleate double bonds likely contributed to negation of the negative effect on the methanogenic activity. Methane formation from oleate was also accelerated in the presence of cysteine or serine, while sulfate decreased the cumulative methane formation from oleate. Neither cysteine nor serine was converted to methane, and their accelerating effects was associated to different mechanisms due to establishment of microbial communities with different structures, as evidenced by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. These outcomes contribute with new knowledge to develop strategies for optimum use of sulfur- and lipid-rich wastes in anaerobic digestion processes.",

    "abstract": "Periodontal disease has been associated with atherosclerosis, suggesting that bacteria from the oral cavity may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the gut microbiota may affect obesity, which is associated with atherosclerosis. Using qPCR, we show that bacterial DNA was present in the atherosclerotic plaque and that the amount of DNA correlated with the amount of leukocytes in the atherosclerotic plaque. To investigate the microbial composition of atherosclerotic plaques and test the hypothesis that the oral or gut microbiota may contribute to atherosclerosis in humans, we used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to survey the bacterial diversity of atherosclerotic plaque, oral, and gut samples of 15 patients with atherosclerosis, and oral and gut samples of healthy controls. We identified Chryseomonas in all atherosclerotic plaque samples, and Veillonella and Streptococcus in the majority. Interestingly, the combined abundances of Veillonella and Streptococcus in atherosclerotic plaques correlated with their abundance in the oral cavity. Moreover, several additional bacterial phylotypes were common to the atherosclerotic plaque and oral or gut samples within the same individual. Interestingly, several bacterial taxa in the oral cavity and the gut correlated with plasma cholesterol levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that bacteria from the oral cavity, and perhaps even the gut, may correlate with disease markers of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings have implicated the gut microbiota as a contributor of metabolic diseases through the modulation of host metabolism and inflammation. Atherosclerosis is associated with lipid accumulation and inflammation in the arterial wall, and bacteria have been suggested as a causative agent of this disease. Here we use shotgun sequencing of the gut metagenome to demonstrate that the genus Collinsella was enriched in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis, defined as stenotic atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery leading to cerebrovascular events, whereas Roseburia and Eubacterium were enriched in healthy controls. Further characterization of the functional capacity of the metagenomes revealed that patient gut metagenomes were enriched in genes encoding peptidoglycan synthesis and depleted in phytoene dehydrogenase; patients also had reduced serum levels of β-carotene. Our findings suggest that the gut metagenome is associated with the inflammatory status of the host and patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis harbor characteristic changes in the gut metagenome.",

    "title": "Dark carbon fixation is a common process in the water column of stratified boreal lakes.",
    "abstract": "CO2 fixation (i.e. primary production) is a key function of all ecosystems, providing the carbon and energy that fuel the entire food web. It also plays an important role in mitigating climate change as CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas. While photosynthesis is regarded as the most important carbon fixation pathway, prokaryotes able to fix carbon in the absence of light (chemolithoautotrophs) can also be a significant source of energy in a light-limited ecosystem. Boreal lakes, notoriously colored and stratified with respect to oxygen and nutrients, present ideal conditions for this so-called dark carbon fixation by the chemolithoautotrophs. However, the prevalence of dark carbon fixation in boreal lakes remains unknown. Here, we measured dark carbon fixation in Swedish lakes from the boreal and boreo-nemoral zones, during summer stratification. We detected dark carbon fixation in 16 out of the 17 lakes studied, and concluded that dark fixation is a widespread phenomenon in boreal lakes. Moreover, the average dark primary production ranged from 18.5 % in the epilimnion to 81.4 % in the hypolimnion of all tested lakes. Our data further suggests that chemolithoautotrophic activity is mostly driven by iron-oxidizing bacteria. The chemolithoautotrophic guild is diverse and seems to be composed of both ubiquitous bacteria, like Gallionellaceae or Chromatiaceae, and endemic taxa, such as Ferrovaceae, which appears to be favored by a low pH. These results are particularly exciting as they suggest that dark carbon fixation could partly compensate for the low photosynthetic capacity in lakes with dark-colored water.",

    "title": "Epigenetic changes in the CYP2D6 gene are related to severity of suicide attempt: A cross-sectional study of suicide attempters.",
    "abstract": "The ability to accurately estimate risk of suicide deaths on an individual level remains elusive.\n\nThis study reports on a case-control study set-up from a well-characterized cohort of 88 predominantly female suicide attempters (SA), stratified into low- (n = 57) and high-risk groups (n = 31) based on reports of later death by suicide, as well as degree of intent-to-die and lethality of SA method. We perform an unbiased analysis of 12,930 whole-blood derived CpG-sites (Illumina Infinium EPIC BeadChip) previously demonstrated to be more conciliable with brain-derived variations. The candidate site was validated by pyrosequencing. External replication was performed in (1) relation to age at index suicide attempt in 97 women with emotionally unstable personality disorder (whole-blood) and (2) death by suicide in a mixed group of 183 prefrontal-cortex (PFC) derived samples who died by suicide or from non-psychiatric etiologies.\n\nCYP2D6-coupled CpG-site cg07016288 was hypomethylated in severe suicidal behavior (p < 10E-06). Results were validated by pyrosequencing (p < 0.01). Replication analyses demonstrate hypomethylation of cg07016288 in relation to age at index SA in females (p < 0.05) and hypermethylation in PFC of male suicide completers (p < 0.05).\n\nGenotyping of CYP2D6 was not performed and CpG-site associations to gene expression were not explored.\n\nCYP2D6-coupled epigenetic markers are hypomethylated in females in dependency of features known to confer increased risk of suicide deaths and hypermethylated in PFC of male suicide completers. Further elucidating the role of CYP2D6 in severe suicidality or suicide deaths hold promise to deduce clinically meaningful results.",

    "title": "Partial genomic survival of cave bears in living brown bears.",
    "abstract": "Although many large mammal species went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, their DNA may persist due to past episodes of interspecies admixture. However, direct empirical evidence of the persistence of ancient alleles remains scarce. Here, we present multifold coverage genomic data from four Late Pleistocene cave bears (Ursus spelaeus complex) and show that cave bears hybridized with brown bears (Ursus arctos) during the Pleistocene. We develop an approach to assess both the directionality and relative timing of gene flow. We find that segments of cave bear DNA still persist in the genomes of living brown bears, with cave bears contributing 0.9 to 2.4% of the genomes of all brown bears investigated. Our results show that even though extinction is typically considered as absolute, following admixture, fragments of the gene pool of extinct species can survive for tens of thousands of years in the genomes of extant recipient species.",

    "title": "The Enterprise, a massive transposon carrying Spok meiotic drive genes.",
    "abstract": "The genomes of eukaryotes are full of parasitic sequences known as transposable elements (TEs). Here, we report the discovery of a putative giant tyrosine-recombinase-mobilized DNA transposon, Enterprise, from the model fungus Podospora anserina Previously, we described a large genomic feature called the Spok block which is notable due to the presence of meiotic drive genes of the Spok gene family. The Spok block ranges from 110 kb to 247 kb and can be present in at least four different genomic locations within P. anserina, despite what is an otherwise highly conserved genome structure. We propose that the reason for its varying positions is that the Spok block is not only capable of meiotic drive but is also capable of transposition. More precisely, the Spok block represents a unique case where the Enterprise has captured the Spoks, thereby parasitizing a resident genomic parasite to become a genomic hyperparasite. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Enterprise (without the Spoks) is found in other fungal lineages, where it can be as large as 70 kb. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence that the Spok block is deleterious, with detrimental effects on spore production in strains which carry it. This union of meiotic drivers and a transposon has created a selfish element of impressive size in Podospora, challenging our perception of how TEs influence genome evolution and broadening the horizons in terms of what the upper limit of transposition may be.",

    "title": "The ketogenic diet influences taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiota in children with severe epilepsy.",
    "abstract": "The gut microbiota has been linked to various neurological disorders via the gut-brain axis. Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer's, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapy-resistant epilepsy before starting KD and after 3 months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, both taxonomic and functional profiles were established. Here we report that alpha diversity is not changed significantly during the diet, but differences in both taxonomic and functional composition are detected. Relative abundance of bifidobacteria as well as E. rectale and Dialister is significantly diminished during the intervention. An increase in relative abundance of E. coli is observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicates that bifidobacteria and Escherichia are important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As relative abundance of health-promoting, fiber-consuming bacteria becomes less abundant during KD, we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD.",

    "title": "Inversions maintain differences between migratory phenotypes of a songbird.",
    "abstract": "Structural rearrangements have been shown to be important in local adaptation and speciation, but have been difficult to reliably identify and characterize in non-model species. Here we combine long reads, linked reads and optical mapping to characterize three divergent chromosome regions in the willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, of which two are associated with differences in migration and one with an environmental gradient. We show that there are inversions (0.4-13 Mb) in each of the regions and that the divergence times between inverted and non-inverted haplotypes are similar across the regions (~1.2 Myrs), which is compatible with a scenario where inversions arose in either of two allopatric populations that subsequently hybridized. The improved genomes allow us to detect additional functional differences in the divergent regions, providing candidate genes for migration and adaptations to environmental gradients.",

    "title": "Two extended haplotype blocks are associated with adaptation to high altitude habitats in East African honey bees.",
    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of adaption is a central task in biology. Populations of the honey bee Apis mellifera that inhabit the mountain forests of East Africa differ in behavior and morphology from those inhabiting the surrounding lowland savannahs, which likely reflects adaptation to these habitats. We performed whole genome sequencing on 39 samples of highland and lowland bees from two pairs of populations to determine their evolutionary affinities and identify the genetic basis of these putative adaptations. We find that in general, levels of genetic differentiation between highland and lowland populations are very low, consistent with them being a single panmictic population. However, we identify two loci on chromosomes 7 and 9, each several hundred kilobases in length, which exhibit near fixation for different haplotypes between highland and lowland populations. The highland haplotypes at these loci are extremely rare in samples from the rest of the world. Patterns of segregation of genetic variants suggest that recombination between haplotypes at each locus is suppressed, indicating that they comprise independent structural variants. The haplotype on chromosome 7 harbors nearly all octopamine receptor genes in the honey bee genome. These have a role in learning and foraging behavior in honey bees and are strong candidates for adaptation to highland habitats. Molecular analysis of a putative breakpoint indicates that it may disrupt the coding sequence of one of these genes. Divergence between the highland and lowland haplotypes at both loci is extremely high suggesting that they are ancient balanced polymorphisms that greatly predate divergence between the extant honey bee subspecies.",

    "title": "Comparison of total and cytoplasmic mRNA reveals global regulation by nuclear retention and miRNAs.",
    "abstract": "The majority of published gene-expression studies have used RNA isolated from whole cells, overlooking the potential impact of including nuclear transcriptome in the analyses. In this study, mRNA fractions from the cytoplasm and from whole cells (total RNA) were prepared from three human cell lines and sequenced using massive parallel sequencing.\n\nFor all three cell lines, of about 15000 detected genes approximately 400 to 1400 genes were detected in different amounts in the cytoplasmic and total RNA fractions. Transcripts detected at higher levels in the total RNA fraction had longer coding sequences and higher number of miRNA target sites. Transcripts detected at higher levels in the cytoplasmic fraction were shorter or contained shorter untranslated regions. Nuclear retention of transcripts and mRNA degradation via miRNA pathway might contribute to this differential detection of genes. The consequence of the differential detection was further investigated by comparison to proteomics data. Interestingly, the expression profiles of cytoplasmic and total RNA correlated equally well with protein abundance levels indicating regulation at a higher level.\n\nWe conclude that expression levels derived from the total RNA fraction be regarded as an appropriate estimate of the amount of mRNAs present in a given cell population, independent of the coding sequence length or UTRs.",

    "title": "Transposon activity, local duplications and propagation of structural variants across haplotypes drive the evolution of the Drosophila S2 cell line.",
    "abstract": "Immortalized cell lines are widely used model systems whose genomes are often highly rearranged and polyploid. However, their genome structure is seldom deciphered and is thus not accounted for during analyses. We therefore used linked short- and long-read sequencing to perform haplotype-level reconstruction of the genome of a Drosophila melanogaster cell line (S2-DRSC) with a complex genome structure.\r\n\r\nUsing a custom implementation (that is designed to use ultra-long reads in complex genomes with nested rearrangements) to call structural variants (SVs), we found that the most common SV was repetitive sequence insertion or deletion (> 80% of SVs), with Gypsy retrotransposon insertions dominating. The second most common SV was local sequence duplication. SNPs and other SVs were rarer, but several large chromosomal translocations and mitochondrial genome insertions were observed. Haplotypes were highly similar at the nucleotide level but structurally very different. Insertion SVs existed at various haplotype frequencies and were unlinked on chromosomes, demonstrating that haplotypes have different structures and suggesting the existence of a mechanism that allows SVs to propagate across haplotypes. Finally, using public short-read data, we found that transposable element insertions and local duplications are common in other D. melanogaster cell lines.\r\n\r\nThe S2-DRSC cell line evolved through retrotransposon activity and vast local sequence duplications, that we hypothesize were the products of DNA re-replication events. Additionally, mutations can propagate across haplotypes (possibly explained by mitotic recombination), which enables fine-tuning of mutational impact and prevents accumulation of deleterious events, an inherent problem of clonal reproduction. We conclude that traditional linear homozygous genome representation conceals the complexity when dealing with rearranged and heterozygous clonal cells.",

    "title": "Genomic sequencing of a dyslexia susceptibility haplotype encompassing ROBO1.",
    "abstract": "The DYX5 locus for developmental dyslexia was mapped to chromosome 3 by linkage study of a large Finnish family, and later, roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) was implicated as a candidate gene at DYX5 with suppressed expression from the segregating rare haplotype. A functional magnetoencephalographic study of several family members revealed abnormal auditory processing of interaural interaction, supporting a defect in midline crossing of auditory pathways. In the current study, we have characterized genetic variation in the broad ROBO1 gene region in the DYX5-linked family, aiming to identify variants that would increase our understanding of the altered expression of ROBO1.\n\nWe have used a whole genome sequencing strategy on a pooled sample of 19 individuals in combination with two individually sequenced genomes. The discovered genetic variants were annotated and filtered. Subsequently, the most interesting variants were functionally tested using relevant methods, including electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), luciferase assay, and gene knockdown by lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in lymphoblasts.\n\nWe found one novel intronic single nucleotide variant (SNV) and three novel intergenic SNVs in the broad region of ROBO1 that were specific to the dyslexia susceptibility haplotype. Functional testing by EMSA did not support the binding of transcription factors to three of the SNVs, but one of the SNVs was bound by the LIM homeobox 2 (LHX2) protein, with increased binding affinity for the non-reference allele. Knockdown of LHX2 in lymphoblast cell lines extracted from subjects from the DYX5-linked family showed decreasing expression of ROBO1, supporting the idea that LHX2 regulates ROBO1 also in human.\n\nThe discovered variants may explain the segregation of dyslexia in this family, but the effect appears subtle in the experimental settings. Their impact on the developing human brain remains suggestive based on the association and subtle experimental support.",

    "title": "Triazole fungicides induce adipogenesis and repress osteoblastogenesis in zebrafish.",
    "abstract": "Triazoles are a major group of azole fungicides commonly used in agriculture, and veterinary and human medicine. Maternal exposure to certain triazole antifungal medication causes congenital malformations, including skeletal malformations. We hypothesized that triazoles used as pesticides in agriculture also pose a risk of causing skeletal malformations in developing embryos. In this study, teratogenic effects of three commonly used triazoles, cyproconazole, paclobutrazol, and triadimenol, were investigated in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Exposure to the triazole fungicides caused bone and cartilage malformations in developing zebrafish larvae. Data from whole-embryo transcriptomics with cyproconazole suggested that exposure to this compound induces adipogenesis while repressing skeletal development. Confirming this finding, the expression of selected bone and cartilage marker genes were significantly downregulated with triazoles exposure as determined by quantitative PCR. The expression of selected adipogenic genes was upregulated by the triazoles. Furthermore, exposure to each of the three triazoles induced adipogenesis and lipid droplet formation in vitro in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells. In vivo in zebrafish larvae, cyproconazole exposure caused lipid accumulation. These results suggest that exposure to triazoles promotes adipogenesis at the expense of skeletal development, and thus they expand the chemical group of bona fide bone to fat switchers.",

    "abstract": "*Here, species composition and biomass production of actively growing ectomycorrhizal (EM) mycelia were studied over the rotation period of managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands in south-western Sweden. *The EM mycelia were collected using ingrowth mesh bags incubated in the forest soil during one growing season. Fungal biomass was estimated by ergosterol analysis and the EM species were identified by 454 sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons. Nutrient availability and the fungal biomass in soil samples were also estimated. *Biomass production peaked in young stands (10-30 yr old) before the first thinning phase. Tylospora fibrillosa dominated the EM community, especially in these young stands, where it constituted 80% of the EM amplicons derived from the mesh bags. Species richness increased in older stands. *The establishment of EM mycelial networks in young Norway spruce stands requires large amounts of carbon, while much less is needed to sustain the EM community in older stands. The variation in EM biomass production over the rotation period has implications for carbon sequestration rates in forest soils.",

    "title": "Ecogenomics and cultivation reveal distinctive viral-bacterial communities in the surface microlayer of a Baltic Sea slick.",
    "abstract": "Visible surface films, termed slicks, can extensively cover freshwater and marine ecosystems, with coastal regions being particularly susceptible to their presence. The sea-surface microlayer (SML), the upper 1-mm at the air-water interface in slicks (herein slick SML) harbors a distinctive bacterial community, but generally little is known about SML viruses. Using flow cytometry, metagenomics, and cultivation, we characterized viruses and bacteria in a brackish slick SML in comparison to non-slick SML as well as seawater below slick and non-slick areas (subsurface water = SSW). Size-fractionated filtration of all samples distinguished viral attachment to hosts and particles. The slick SML contained higher abundances of virus-like particles, prokaryotic cells, and dissolved organic carbon compared to non-slick SML and SSW. The community of 428 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), 426 predicted as lytic, distinctly differed across all size fractions in the slick SML compared to non-slick SML and SSW. Specific metabolic profiles of bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes and isolates in the slick SML included a prevalence of genes encoding motility and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). Several vOTUs were enriched in slick SML, and many virus variants were associated with particles. Nine vOTUs were only found in slick SML, six of them being targeted by slick SML-specific clustered-regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) spacers likely originating from Gammaproteobacteria. Moreover, isolation of three previously unknown lytic phages for Alishewanella sp. and Pseudoalteromonas tunicata, abundant and actively replicating slick SML bacteria, suggests that viral activity in slicks contributes to biogeochemical cycling in coastal ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Genomic instability contributes to the neoplastic phenotype by deregulating key cancer-related genes, which in turn can have a detrimental effect on patient outcome. DNA amplification of the 8p11-p12 genomic region has clinical and biological implications in multiple malignancies, including breast carcinoma where the amplicon has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. However, oncogenes driving increased cancer-related death and recurrent genetic features associated with the 8p11-p12 amplicon remain to be identified. In this study, DNA copy number and transcriptome profiling data for 229 primary invasive breast carcinomas (corresponding to 185 patients) were evaluated in conjunction with clinicopathological features to identify putative oncogenes in 8p11-p12 amplified samples. Illumina paired-end whole transcriptome sequencing and whole-genome SNP genotyping were subsequently performed on 23 samples showing high-level regional 8p11-p12 amplification to characterize recurrent genetic variants (SNPs and indels), expressed gene fusions, gene expression profiles and allelic imbalances. We now show previously undescribed chromothripsis-like patterns spanning the 8p11-p12 genomic region and allele-specific DNA amplification events. In addition, recurrent amplification-specific genetic features were identified, including genetic variants in the HIST1H1E and UQCRHL genes and fusion transcripts containing MALAT1 non-coding RNA, which is known to be a prognostic indicator for breast cancer and stimulated by estrogen. In summary, these findings highlight novel candidate targets for improved treatment of 8p11-p12 amplified breast carcinomas.",

    "title": "Natural Selection and Recombination Rate Variation Shape Nucleotide Polymorphism Across the Genomes of Three Related Populus Species.",
    "abstract": "A central aim of evolutionary genomics is to identify the relative roles that various evolutionary forces have played in generating and shaping genetic variation within and among species. Here we use whole-genome resequencing data to characterize and compare genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism, site frequency spectrum, and population-scaled recombination rates in three species of Populus: Populus tremula, P. tremuloides, and P. trichocarpa. We find that P. tremuloides has the highest level of genome-wide variation, skewed allele frequencies, and population-scaled recombination rates, whereas P. trichocarpa harbors the lowest. Our findings highlight multiple lines of evidence suggesting that natural selection, due to both purifying and positive selection, has widely shaped patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at linked neutral sites in all three species. Differences in effective population sizes and rates of recombination largely explain the disparate magnitudes and signatures of linked selection that we observe among species. The present work provides the first phylogenetic comparative study on a genome-wide scale in forest trees. This information will also improve our ability to understand how various evolutionary forces have interacted to influence genome evolution among related species.",

    "title": "The influence of population structure on gene expression and flowering time variation in the ubiquitous weed Capsella bursa-pastoris (Brassicaceae).",
    "abstract": "Population structure is a potential problem when testing for adaptive phenotypic differences among populations. The observed phenotypic differences among populations can simply be due to genetic drift, and if the genetic distance between them is not considered, the differentiation may be falsely interpreted as adaptive. Conversely, adaptive and demographic processes might have been tightly associated and correcting for the population structure may lead to false negatives. Here, we evaluated this problem in the cosmopolitan weed Capsella bursa-pastoris. We used RNA-Seq to analyse gene expression differences among 24 accessions, which belonged to a much larger group that had been previously characterized for flowering time and circadian rhythm and were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique. We found that clustering of accessions for gene expression retrieved the same three clusters that were obtained with GBS data previously, namely Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Moreover, the three groups were also differentiated for both flowering time and circadian rhythm variation. Correction for population genetic structure when analysing differential gene expression analysis removed all differences among the three groups. This may suggest that most differences are neutral and simply reflect population history. However, geographical variation in flowering time and circadian rhythm indicated that the distribution of adaptive traits might be confounded by population structure. To bypass this confounding effect, we compared gene expression differentiation between flowering ecotypes within the genetic groups. Among the differentially expressed genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C was the strongest candidate for local adaptation in regulation of flowering time.",

    "abstract": "Bacterioplankton are main drivers of biogeochemical cycles and important components of aquatic food webs. While sequencing-based studies have revealed how bacterioplankton communities are structured in time and space, relatively little is known about intraspecies diversity patterns and their ecological relevance. Here, we use the newly developed software POGENOM (POpulation GENomics from Metagenomes) to investigate genomic diversity and differentiation in metagenome-assembled genomes from the Baltic Sea, and investigate their genomic variation using metagenome data spanning a 1700 km transect and covering seasonal variation at one station. The majority of the investigated species, representing several major bacterioplankton clades, displayed population structures correlating significantly with environmental factors such as salinity and temperature. Population differentiation was more pronounced over spatial than temporal scales. We discovered genes that have undergone adaptation to different salinity regimes, potentially responsible for the populations' existence along with the salinity range. This in turn implies the broad existence of ecotypes that may remain undetected by rRNA gene sequencing. Our findings emphasize the importance of physiological barriers, and highlight the role of adaptive divergence as a structuring mechanism of bacterioplankton species.",
