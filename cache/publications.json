    "title": "Contribution of antibody-based protein profiling to the human Chromosome-centric Proteome Project (C-HPP).",
    "abstract": "A gene-centric Human Proteome Project has been proposed to characterize the human protein-coding genes in a chromosome-centered manner to understand human biology and disease. Here, we report on the protein evidence for all genes predicted from the genome sequence based on manual annotation from literature (UniProt), antibody-based profiling in cells, tissues and organs and analysis of the transcript profiles using next generation sequencing in human cell lines of different origins. We estimate that there is good evidence for protein existence for 69% (n = 13985) of the human protein-coding genes, while 23% have only evidence on the RNA level and 7% still lack experimental evidence. Analysis of the expression patterns shows few tissue-specific proteins and approximately half of the genes expressed in all the analyzed cells. The status for each gene with regards to protein evidence is visualized in a chromosome-centric manner as part of a new version of the Human Protein Atlas ( www.proteinatlas.org ).",

    "abstract": "B vitamins are essential cofactors for practically all living organisms on Earth and are produced by a selection of microorganisms. An imbalance between high demand and limited production, in concert with abiotic processes, may explain the low availability of these vitamins in marine systems. Natural microbial communities from surface shelf water in the productive area off northwestern Spain were enclosed in mesocosms in winter, spring, and summer 2016. In order to explore the impact of B-vitamin availability on microbial community composition (16S and 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis) and bacterial function (metatranscriptomics analysis) in different seasons, enrichment experiments were conducted with seawater from the mesocosms. Our findings revealed that significant increases in phytoplankton or prokaryote biomass associated with vitamin B12 and/or B1 amendments were not accompanied by significant changes in community composition, suggesting that most of the microbial taxa benefited from the external B-vitamin supply. Metatranscriptome analysis suggested that many bacteria were potential consumers of vitamins B12 and B1, although the relative abundance of reads related to synthesis was ca. 3.6-fold higher than that related to uptake. Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales accounted for important portions of vitamin B1 and B12 synthesis gene transcription, despite accounting for only minor portions of the bacterial community. Flavobacteriales appeared to be involved mostly in vitamin B12 and B1 uptake, and Pelagibacterales expressed genes involved in vitamin B1 uptake. Interestingly, the relative expression of vitamin B12 and B1 synthesis genes among bacteria strongly increased upon inorganic nutrient amendment. Collectively, these findings suggest that upwelling events intermittently occurring during spring and summer in productive ecosystems may ensure an adequate production of these cofactors to sustain high levels of phytoplankton growth and biomass. IMPORTANCE B vitamins are essential growth factors for practically all living organisms on Earth that are produced by a selection of microorganisms. An imbalance between high demand and limited production may explain the low concentration of these compounds in marine systems. In order to explore the impact of B-vitamin availability on bacteria and algae in the coastal waters off northwestern Spain, six experiments were conducted with natural surface water enclosed in winter, spring, and summer. Our findings revealed that increases in phytoplankton or bacterial growth associated with B12 and/or B1 amendments were not accompanied by significant changes in community composition, suggesting that most microorganisms benefited from the B-vitamin supply. Our analyses confirmed the role of many bacteria as consumers of vitamins B12 and B1, although the relative abundance of genes related to synthesis was ca. 3.6-fold higher than that related to uptake. Interestingly, prokaryote expression of B12 and B1 synthesis genes strongly increased when inorganic nutrients were added. Collectively, these findings suggest that upwelling of cold and nutrient-rich waters occurring during spring and summer in this coastal area may ensure an adequate production of B vitamins to sustain high levels of algae growth and biomass.",

    "title": "Avian neo-sex chromosomes reveal dynamics of recombination suppression and W degeneration.",
    "abstract": "How the avian sex chromosomes first evolved from autosomes remains elusive as 100 million years (Myr) of divergence and degeneration obscure their evolutionary history. The Sylvioidea group of songbirds is interesting for understanding avian sex chromosome evolution because a chromosome fusion event ∼24 Myr ago formed \"neo-sex chromosomes\" consisting of an added (new) and an ancestral (old) part. Here, we report the complete female genome (ZW) of one Sylvioidea species, the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Our long-read assembly shows that the added region has been translocated to both Z and W, and while the added-Z has remained its gene order the added-W part has been heavily rearranged. Phylogenetic analyses show that recombination between the homologous added-Z and -W regions continued after the fusion event, and that recombination suppression across this region took several million years to be completed. Moreover, recombination suppression was initiated across multiple positions over the added-Z, which is not consistent with a simple linear progression starting from the fusion point. As expected following recombination suppression, the added-W show signs of degeneration including repeat accumulation and gene loss. Finally, we present evidence for non-random maintenance of slowly evolving and dosage-sensitive genes on both ancestral- and added-W, a process causing correlated evolution among orthologous genes across broad taxonomic groups, regardless of sex-linkage.",

    "title": "Gene co-expression network connectivity is an important determinant of selective constraint.",
    "abstract": "While several studies have investigated general properties of the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression, few of these have considered natural, outbreeding populations. In parallel, systems biology has established that a general feature of biological networks is that they are scale-free, rendering them buffered against random mutations. To date, few studies have attempted to examine the relationship between the selective processes acting to maintain natural variation of gene expression and the associated co-expression network structure. Here we utilised RNA-Sequencing to assay gene expression in winter buds undergoing bud flush in a natural population of Populus tremula, an outbreeding forest tree species. We performed expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping and identified 164,290 significant eQTLs associating 6,241 unique genes (eGenes) with 147,419 unique SNPs (eSNPs). We found approximately four times as many local as distant eQTLs, with local eQTLs having significantly higher effect sizes. eQTLs were primarily located in regulatory regions of genes (UTRs or flanking regions), regardless of whether they were local or distant. We used the gene expression data to infer a co-expression network and investigated the relationship between network topology, the genetic architecture of gene expression and signatures of selection. Within the co-expression network, eGenes were underrepresented in network module cores (hubs) and overrepresented in the periphery of the network, with a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and network connectivity. We additionally found that module core genes have experienced stronger selective constraint on coding and non-coding sequence, with connectivity associated with signatures of selection. Our integrated genetics and genomics results suggest that purifying selection is the primary mechanism underlying the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression assayed in flushing leaf buds of P. tremula and that connectivity within the co-expression network is linked to the strength of purifying selection.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA (aDNA) obtained from human remains is typically fragmented and present in relatively low amounts. Here we investigate a set of optimal methods for producing aDNA data by comparing silica-based DNA extraction and aDNA library preparation protocols. We also test the efficiency of whole-genome enrichment (WGC) on ancient human samples by modifying a number of parameter combinations. We find that the Dabney extraction protocol performs significantly better than alternatives. We further observed a positive trend with the BEST library protocol indicating lower clonality. Notably, our results suggest that WGC is effective at retrieving endogenous DNA, particularly from poorly-preserved human samples, by increasing human endogenous proportions by 5x. Thus, aDNA studies will be most likely to benefit from our results.",

    "title": "Immobilization of sulfate and thiosulfate-reducing biomass on sand under haloalkaline conditions.",
    "abstract": "Biological sulfate and thiosulfate reduction under haloalkaline conditions can be applied to treat waste streams from biodesulfurization systems. However, the lack of microbial aggregation under haloalkaline conditions limits the volumetric rates of sulfate and thiosulfate reducing bioreactors. As biomass retention in haloalkaline bioreactors has not been studied before, sand was chosen as a biomass carrier material to increase cell retention and consequently raise the volumetric rates. The results showed that ~10 fold higher biomass concentrations could be achieved with sand, compared to previous studies without carrier addition. The volumetric rates of sulfate/thiosulfate reduction increased approximately 4.5 times. Biomass attachment to the sand was restricted to cavities within the sand particles. Acetate produced by acetogenic bacteria from H2 and CO2 was used as carbon source for biomass growth, while formate that was also produced from H2 and CO2 enhanced sulfate reduction. The microbial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and Tindallia related bacteria were probably responsible for formate formation from hydrogen. The community attached to the sand particles was similar to the suspended fraction, but the relative abundance of sequences most closely related to Desulfohalobiaceae was much higher in the attached fraction compared to the suspended fraction (30% and 13%, respectively). The results indicated that even though the biomass attachment to sand was poor, it still increased the biomass concentration and consequently the sulfate and thiosulfate reduction volumetric rates.",

    "title": "Different mutations in PDE4D associated with developmental disorders with mirror phenotypes.",
    "abstract": "Point mutations in PDE4D have been recently linked to acrodysostosis, an autosomal dominant disorder with skeletal dysplasia, severe brachydactyly, midfacial hypoplasia and intellectual disability. The purpose of the present study was to investigate clinical and cellular implications of different types of mutations in the PDE4D gene.\n\nWe studied five acrodysostosis patients and three patients with gene dose imbalances involving PDE4D clinically and by whole exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing and array comparative hybridisation. To evaluate the functional consequences of the PDE4D changes, we used overexpression of mutated human PDE4D message and morpholino-based suppression of pde4d in zebrafish.\n\nWe identified three novel and two previously described PDE4D point mutations in the acrodysostosis patients and two deletions and one duplication involving PDE4D in three patients suffering from an intellectual disability syndrome with low body mass index, long fingers, toes and arms, prominent nose and small chin. When comparing symptoms in patients with missense mutations and gene dose imbalances involving PDE4D, a mirror phenotype was observed. By comparing overexpression of human mutated transcripts with pde4d knockdown in zebrafish embryos, we could successfully assay the pathogenicity of the mutations.\n\nOur findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of PDE4D results in a novel intellectual disability syndrome, the 5q12.1-haploinsufficiency syndrome, with several opposing features compared with acrodysostosis that is caused by dominant negative mutations. In addition, our results expand the spectrum of PDE4D mutations underlying acrodysostosis and indicate that, in contrast to previous reports, patients with PDE4D mutations may have significant hormone resistance with consequent endocrine abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone (DEX), are clinically prescribed due to their immunoregulatory properties. In excess they can perturb glucose homeostasis, with individuals predisposed to glucose intolerance more sensitive to these negative effects. While DEX is known to negatively impact β-cell function, it is unclear how. Hence, our aim was to investigate the effect of DEX on β-cell function, both alone and in combination with a diabetogenic milieu in the form of elevated glucose and palmitate.\n\nHuman pancreatic EndoC-βH1 cells were cultured in the presence of high glucose and palmitate (glucolipotoxicity) and/or a pharmacological concentration of DEX, before functional and molecular analyses.\n\nEither treatment alone resulted in reduced insulin content and secretion, while the combination of DEX and glucolipotoxicity promoted a strong synergistic effect. These effects were associated with reduced insulin biosynthesis, likely due to downregulation of PDX1, MAFA, and the proinsulin converting enzymes, as well as reduced ATP response upon glucose stimulation. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found changes on PDE4D, MBNL1 and TMEM178B, all implicated in β-cell function, after all three treatments. DEX alone caused very strong demethylation of the glucocorticoid-regulated gene ZBTB16, also known to influence the β-cell, while the combined treatment caused altered methylation of many known β-cell regulators and diabetes candidate genes.\n\nDEX treatment and glucolipotoxic conditions separately alter the β-cell epigenome and function. The combination of both treatments exacerbates these changes, showing that caution is needed when prescribing potent glucocorticoids in patients with dysregulated metabolism.",

    "title": "Genome-wide association study identifies Sjögren's risk loci with functional implications in immune and glandular cells.",
    "abstract": "Sjögren's disease is a complex autoimmune disease with twelve established susceptibility loci. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifies ten novel genome-wide significant (GWS) regions in Sjögren's cases of European ancestry: CD247, NAB1, PTTG1-MIR146A, PRDM1-ATG5, TNFAIP3, XKR6, MAPT-CRHR1, RPTOR-CHMP6-BAIAP6, TYK2, SYNGR1. Polygenic risk scores yield predictability (AUROC = 0.71) and relative risk of 12.08. Interrogation of bioinformatics databases refine the associations, define local regulatory networks of GWS SNPs from the 95% credible set, and expand the implicated gene list to >40. Many GWS SNPs are eQTLs for genes within topologically associated domains in immune cells and/or eQTLs in the main target tissue, salivary glands.",

    "title": "Rho-associated kinase is a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.",
    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a peripheral neural system tumor that originates from the neural crest and is the most common and deadly tumor of infancy. Here we show that neuroblastoma harbors frequent mutations of genes controlling the Rac/Rho signaling cascade important for proper migration and differentiation of neural crest cells during neuritogenesis. RhoA is activated in tumors from neuroblastoma patients, and elevated expression of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)2 is associated with poor patient survival. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ROCK1 and 2, key molecules in Rho signaling, resulted in neuroblastoma cell differentiation and inhibition of neuroblastoma cell growth, migration, and invasion. Molecularly, ROCK inhibition induced glycogen synthase kinase 3β-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of MYCN protein. Small-molecule inhibition of ROCK suppressed MYCN-driven neuroblastoma growth in TH-MYCN homozygous transgenic mice and MYCN gene-amplified neuroblastoma xenograft growth in nude mice. Interference with Rho/Rac signaling might offer therapeutic perspectives for high-risk neuroblastoma.",

    "title": "The DMRT3 'Gait keeper' mutation affects performance of Nordic and Standardbred trotters.",
    "abstract": "In a previous study it was shown that a nonsense mutation in the DMRT3 gene alters the pattern of locomotion in horses and that this mutation has a strong positive impact on trotting performance of Standardbreds. One aim of this study was to test if racing performance and trotting technique in the Nordic (Coldblood) trotters are also influenced by the DMRT3 genotype. Another aim was to further investigate the effect of the mutation on performance in Standardbreds, by using a within-family analysis and genotype-phenotype correlations in a larger horse material than in the previous study. We genotyped 427 Nordic trotters and 621 Standardbreds for the DMRT3 nonsense mutation and a SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium with it. In Nordic trotters, we show that horses homozygous for the DMRT3 mutation (A) had significantly higher EBV for trotting performance traits than heterozygous (CA) or homozygous wild-type (CC) horses (P = 0.001). Furthermore, AA homozygotes had a higher proportion of victories and top 3 placings than horses heterozygous or homozygous wild-type, when analyzing performance data for the period 3 to 6 yr of age (P = 0.06 and P = 0.05, respectively). Another finding in the Nordic trotters was that the DMRT3 mutation influenced trotting technique (P = 2.1 × 10(-8)). Standardbred horses homozygous AA had significantly higher EBV for all traits than horses with at least 1 wild-type allele (CA and CC; P = 1.6 × 10(-16)). In a within-family analysis of Standardbreds, we found significant differences in several traits (e.g., earnings, P = 0.002; number of entered races, P = 0.004; and fraction of offspring that entered races, P = 0.002) among paternal half-sibs with genotype AA or CA sired by a CA stallion. For most traits, we found significant differences at young ages. For Nordic trotters, most of the results were significant at 3 yr of age but not for the older ages, and for the Standardbreds most of the results for the ages 3 to 5 were significant. For Nordic trotters, the proportion of victories and placings were the only traits that were significant for other ages than 3 yr.",

    "title": "The human testis-specific proteome defined by transcriptomics and antibody-based profiling.",
    "abstract": "The testis' function is to produce haploid germ cells necessary for reproduction. Here we have combined a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis with immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to characterize the molecular components of the testis. Deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) of normal human testicular tissue from seven individuals was performed and compared with 26 other normal human tissue types. All 20 050 putative human genes were classified into categories based on expression patterns. The analysis shows that testis is the tissue with the most tissue-specific genes by far. More than 1000 genes show a testis-enriched expression pattern in testis when compared with all other analyzed tissues. Highly testis enriched genes were further characterized with respect to protein localization within the testis, such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, sperm, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Here we present an immunohistochemistry-based analysis, showing the localization of corresponding proteins in different cell types and various stages of spermatogenesis, for 62 genes expressed at >50-fold higher levels in testis when compared with other tissues. A large fraction of these genes were unexpectedly expressed in early stages of spermatogenesis. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the human testis-specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling, providing lists of genes expressed in a tissue-enriched manner in the testis. The majority of these genes and proteins were previously poorly characterised in terms of localization and function, and our list provides an important starting point to increase our molecular understanding of human reproductive biology and disease.",

    "title": "Clonal relations in the mouse brain revealed by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.",
    "abstract": "The mammalian brain contains many specialized cells that develop from a thin sheet of neuroepithelial progenitor cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed hundreds of molecularly diverse cell types in the nervous system, but the lineage relationships between mature cell types and progenitor cells are not well understood. Here we show in vivo barcoding of early progenitors to simultaneously profile cell phenotypes and clonal relations in the mouse brain using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. By reconstructing thousands of clones, we discovered fate-restricted progenitor cells in the mouse hippocampal neuroepithelium and show that microglia are derived from few primitive myeloid precursors that massively expand to generate widely dispersed progeny. We combined spatial transcriptomics with clonal barcoding and disentangled migration patterns of clonally related cells in densely labeled tissue sections. Our approach enables high-throughput dense reconstruction of cell phenotypes and clonal relations at the single-cell and tissue level in individual animals and provides an integrated approach for understanding tissue architecture.",

    "title": "Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche.",
    "abstract": "Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.",

    "title": "Complex population structure of the Atlantic puffin revealed by whole genome analyses.",
    "abstract": "The factors underlying gene flow and genomic population structure in vagile seabirds are notoriously difficult to understand due to their complex ecology with diverse dispersal barriers and extensive periods at sea. Yet, such understanding is vital for conservation management of seabirds that are globally declining at alarming rates. Here, we elucidate the population structure of the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) by assembling its reference genome and analyzing genome-wide resequencing data of 72 individuals from 12 colonies. We identify four large, genetically distinct clusters, observe isolation-by-distance between colonies within these clusters, and obtain evidence for a secondary contact zone. These observations disagree with the current taxonomy, and show that a complex set of contemporary biotic factors impede gene flow over different spatial scales. Our results highlight the power of whole genome data to reveal unexpected population structure in vagile marine seabirds and its value for seabird taxonomy, evolution and conservation.",

    "title": "Plant Growth-Promoting Activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa FG106 and Its Ability to Act as a Biocontrol Agent against Potato, Tomato and Taro Pathogens.",
    "abstract": "P. aeruginosa strain FG106 was isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants and identified through morphological analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this strain could control several pathogens on tomato, potato, taro, and strawberry. Volatile and non-volatile metabolites produced by the strain are known to adversely affect the tested pathogens. FG106 showed clear antagonism against Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, Phytophthora colocasiae, P. infestans, Rhizoctonia solani, and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. perforans. FG106 produced proteases and lipases while also inducing high phosphate solubilization, producing siderophores, ammonia, indole acetic acid (IAA), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and forming biofilms that promote plant growth and facilitate biocontrol. Genome mining approaches showed that this strain harbors genes related to biocontrol and growth promotion. These results suggest that this bacterial strain provides good protection against pathogens of several agriculturally important plants via direct and indirect modes of action and could thus be a valuable bio-control agent.",

    "title": "Painting of Fourth and the X-Linked 1.688 Satellite in D. melanogaster is Involved in Chromosome-Wide Gene Regulation.",
    "abstract": "Chromosome-specific regulatory mechanisms provide a model to understand the coordinated regulation of genes on entire chromosomes or on larger genomic regions. In fruit flies, two chromosome-wide systems have been characterized: The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which mediates dosage compensation and primarily acts on the male X-chromosome, and Painting of fourth (POF), which governs chromosome-specific regulation of genes located on the 4th chromosome. How targeting of one specific chromosome evolves is still not understood; but repeated sequences, in forms of satellites and transposable elements, are thought to facilitate the evolution of chromosome-specific targeting. The highly repetitive 1.688 satellite has been functionally connected to both these systems. Considering the rapid evolution and the necessarily constant adaptation of regulatory mechanisms, such as dosage compensation, we hypothesised that POF and/or 1.688 may still show traces of dosage-compensation functions. Here, we test this hypothesis by transcriptome analysis. We show that loss of Pof decreases not only chromosome 4 expression but also reduces the X-chromosome expression in males. The 1.688 repeat deletion, Zhr1 (Zygotic hybrid rescue), does not affect male dosage compensation detectably; however, Zhr1 in females causes a stimulatory effect on X-linked genes with a strong binding affinity to the MSL complex (genes close to high-affinity sites). Lack of pericentromeric 1.688 also affected 1.688 expression in trans and was linked to the differential expression of genes involved in eggshell formation. We discuss our results with reference to the connections between POF, the 1.688 satellite and dosage compensation, and the role of the 1.688 satellite in hybrid lethality.",

    "title": "Transcriptome Analysis of Post-Mortem Brain Tissue Reveals Up-Regulation of the Complement Cascade in a Subgroup of Schizophrenia Patients.",
    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorder with largely unresolved mechanisms of pathology. Identification of genes and pathways associated with schizophrenia is important for understanding the development, progression and treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, pathways associated with schizophrenia were explored at the level of gene expression. The study included post-mortem brain tissue samples from 68 schizophrenia patients and 44 age and sex-matched control subjects. Whole transcriptome poly-A selected paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on tissue from the prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. RNA expression differences were detected between case and control individuals, focusing both on single genes and pathways. The results were validated with RT-qPCR. Significant differential expression between patient and controls groups was found for 71 genes. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed an up-regulation of multiple genes in immune response among the patients (corrected p-value = 0.004). Several genes in the category belong to the complement system, including C1R, C1S, C7, FCN3, SERPING1, C4A and CFI. The increased complement expression is primarily driven by a subgroup of patients with increased expression of immune/inflammatory response genes, pointing to important differences in disease etiology within the patient group. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis highlighted networks associated with both synaptic transmission and activation of the immune response. Our results demonstrate the importance of immune-related pathways in schizophrenia and provide evidence for elevated expression of the complement cascade as an important pathway in schizophrenia pathology.",

    "title": "Environmental effects rather than relatedness determine gut microbiome similarity in a social mammal.",
    "abstract": "In social species, group members commonly show substantial similarity in gut microbiome composition. Such similarities have been hypothesized to arise either by shared environmental effects or by host relatedness. However, disentangling these factors is difficult, because group members are often related, and social groups typically share similar environmental conditions. In this study, we conducted a cross-foster experiment under controlled laboratory conditions in group-living Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) and used 16S amplicon sequencing to disentangle the effects of the environment and relatedness on gut microbiome similarity and diversity. Our results show that a shared environment is the main factor explaining gut microbiome similarity, overshadowing any effect of host relatedness. Together with studies in wild animal populations, our results suggest that among conspecifics environmental factors are more powerful drivers of gut microbiome composition similarity than host genetics.",

    "title": "Statistical Analysis of Community RNA Transcripts between Organic Carbon and Geogas-Fed Continental Deep Biosphere Groundwaters.",
    "abstract": "Life in water-filled bedrock fissures in the continental deep biosphere is broadly constrained by energy and nutrient availability. Although these communities are alive, robust studies comparing active populations and metabolic processes across deep aquifers are lacking. This study analyzed three oligotrophic Fennoscandian Shield groundwaters, two \"modern marine\" waters that are replenished with organic carbon from the Baltic Sea and are likely less than 20 years old (171.3 and 415.4 m below sea level) and an extremely oligotrophic \"thoroughly mixed\" water (448.8 m below sea level) of unknown age that is composed of very old saline and marine waters. Cells were captured either using a sampling device that rapidly fixed RNA under in situ conditions or by filtering flowing groundwater over an extended period before fixation. Comparison of metatranscriptomes between the methods showed statistically similar transcript profiles for the respective water types, and they were analyzed as biological replicates. Study of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA confirmed active populations from all three domains of life, with many potentially novel unclassified populations present. Statistically supported differences between communities included heterotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria in the modern marine water at 171.3 m below sea level that has a higher organic carbon content than do largely autotrophic populations in the H2- and CO2-fed thoroughly mixed water. While this modern marine water had signatures of methanogenesis, syntrophic populations were predominantly in the thoroughly mixed water. The study provides a first statistical evaluation of differences in the active microbial communities in groundwaters differentially fed by organic carbon or \"geogases.\"IMPORTANCE Despite being separated from the photosynthesis-driven surface by both distance and time, the deep biosphere is an important driver for the earth's carbon and energy cycles. However, due to the difficulties in gaining access and low cell numbers, robust statistical omics studies have not been carried out, and this limits the conclusions that can be drawn. This study benchmarks the use of two separate sampling systems and demonstrates that they provide statistically similar RNA transcript profiles, importantly validating several previously published studies. The generated data are analyzed to identify statistically valid differences in active microbial community members and metabolic processes. The results highlight contrasting taxa and growth strategies in the modern marine waters that are influenced by recent infiltration of Baltic Sea water versus the hydrogen- and carbon dioxide-fed, extremely oligotrophic, thoroughly mixed water.",

    "abstract": "Skin homeostasis is orchestrated by dozens of cell types that together direct stem cell renewal, lineage commitment, and differentiation. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and single-molecule RNA FISH to provide a systematic molecular atlas of full-thickness skin, determining gene expression profiles and spatial locations that define 56 cell types and states during hair growth and rest. These findings reveal how the outer root sheath (ORS) and inner hair follicle layers coordinate hair production. We found that the ORS is composed of two intermingling but transcriptionally distinct cell types with differing capacities for interactions with stromal cell types. Inner layer cells branch from transcriptionally uncommitted progenitors, and each lineage differentiation passes through an intermediate state. We also provide an online tool to explore this comprehensive skin cell atlas, including epithelial and stromal cells such as fibroblasts, vascular, and immune cells, to spur further discoveries in skin biology.",

    "title": "Labile Dissolved Organic Matter Compound Characteristics Select for Divergence in Marine Bacterial Activity and Transcription.",
    "abstract": "Bacteria play a key role in the planetary carbon cycle partly because they rapidly assimilate labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean. However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms at work when bacterioplankton metabolize distinct components of the DOM pool is still limited. We, therefore, conducted seawater culture enrichment experiments with ecologically relevant DOM, combining both polymer and monomer model compounds for distinct compound classes. This included carbohydrates (polysaccharides vs. monosaccharides), proteins (polypeptides vs. amino acids), and nucleic acids (DNA vs. nucleotides). We noted pronounced changes in bacterial growth, activity, and transcription related to DOM characteristics. Transcriptional responses differed between compound classes, with distinct gene sets (\"core genes\") distinguishing carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. Moreover, we found a strong divergence in functional transcription at the level of particular monomers and polymers (i.e., the condensation state), primarily in the carbohydrates and protein compound classes. These specific responses included a variety of cellular and metabolic processes that were mediated by distinct bacterial taxa, suggesting pronounced functional partitioning of organic matter. Collectively, our findings show that two important facets of DOM, compound class and condensation state, shape bacterial gene expression, and ultimately select for distinct bacterial (functional) groups. This emphasizes the interdependency of marine bacteria and labile carbon compounds for regulating the transformation of DOM in surface waters.",

    "title": "Genomic and Strontium Isotope Variation Reveal Immigration Patterns in a Viking Age Town.",
    "abstract": "The impact of human mobility on the northern European urban populations during the Viking and Early Middle Ages and its repercussions in Scandinavia itself are still largely unexplored. Our study of the demographics in the final phase of the Viking era is the first comprehensive multidisciplinary investigation that includes genetics, isotopes, archaeology, and osteology on a larger scale. This early Christian dataset is particularly important as the earlier common pagan burial tradition during the Iron Age was cremation, hindering large-scale DNA analyses. We present genome-wide sequence data from 23 individuals from the 10th to 12th century Swedish town of Sigtuna. The data revealed high genetic diversity among the early urban residents. The observed variation exceeds the genetic diversity in distinct modern-day and Iron Age groups of central and northern Europe. Strontium isotope data suggest mixed local and non-local origin of the townspeople. Our results uncover the social system underlying the urbanization process of the Viking World of which mobility was an intricate part and was comparable between males and females. The inhabitants of Sigtuna were heterogeneous in their genetic affinities, probably reflecting both close and distant connections through an established network, confirming that early urbanization processes in northern Europe were driven by migration.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (eIF4A3), a core helicase component of the exon junction complex, is essential for splicing, mRNA trafficking, and nonsense-mediated decay processes emerging as targets in cancer therapy. Here, we unravel eIF4A3's tumor-promoting function by demonstrating its role in ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and p53 (de)regulation. Mechanistically, eIF4A3 resides in nucleoli within the small subunit processome and regulates rRNA processing via R-loop clearance. EIF4A3 depletion induces cell cycle arrest through impaired RiBi checkpoint-mediated p53 induction and reprogrammed translation of cell cycle regulators. Multilevel omics analysis following eIF4A3 depletion pinpoints pathways of cell death regulation and translation of alternative mouse double minute homolog 2 (MDM2) transcript isoforms that control p53. EIF4A3 expression and subnuclear localization among clinical cancer specimens correlate with the RiBi status rendering eIF4A3 an exploitable vulnerability in high-RiBi tumors. We propose a concept of eIF4A3's unexpected role in RiBi, with implications for cancer pathogenesis and treatment.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the pattern of KIT, NRAS, and BRAF mutations in mucosal melanomas at specific sites and to assess activation of the KIT downstream RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways in mucosal melanoma specimens.\n\nSeventy-one primary mucosal melanomas from various sites were studied. Mutation analysis was done by DNA sequencing. Expression of KIT, phosphorylated (p)-ERK, and p-AKT was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\n\nKIT mutations were detected in 35% (8 of 23) of vulvar, 9% (2 of 22) of anorectal, 7% (1 of 14) of nasal cavity, and 20% (1 of 5) of penile melanomas. No KIT mutations were found in 7 vaginal melanomas. The difference in KIT mutation frequency between vulvar and nonvulvar cases was statistically significant (P = 0.014). The overall frequencies of NRAS and BRAF mutations were 10% and 6%, respectively. Notably, vaginal melanomas showed a NRAS mutation rate of 43%. KIT gene amplification (≥4 copies), as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, was observed in 19% of cases. KIT expression was associated with KIT mutation status (P < 0.001) and was more common in vulvar than nonvulvar tumors (P = 0.016). Expression of p-ERK and p-AKT was observed in 42% and 59% of tumors, respectively, and occurred irrespective of KIT/NRAS/BRAF mutation status. NRAS mutation was associated with worse overall survival in univariate analysis.\n\nResults show that KIT mutations are more common in vulvar melanomas than other types of mucosal melanomas and that both the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways are activated in mucosal melanoma specimens.",

    "title": "Next-generation sequencing reveals low-dose effects of cationic dendrimers in primary human bronchial epithelial cells.",
    "abstract": "Gene expression profiling has developed rapidly in recent years with the advent of deep sequencing technologies such as RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) and could be harnessed to predict and define mechanisms of toxicity of chemicals and nanomaterials. However, the full potential of these technologies in (nano)toxicology is yet to be realized. Here, we show that systems biology approaches can uncover mechanisms underlying cellular responses to nanomaterials. Using RNA Seq and computational approaches, we found that cationic poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM-NH2) are capable of triggering down-regulation of cell-cycle-related genes in primary human bronchial epithelial cells at doses that do not elicit acute cytotoxicity, as demonstrated using conventional cell viability assays, while gene transcription was not affected by neutral PAMAM-OH dendrimers. The PAMAMs were internalized in an active manner by lung cells and localized mainly in lysosomes; amine-terminated dendrimers were internalized more efficiently when compared to the hydroxyl-terminated dendrimers. Upstream regulator analysis implicated NF-κB as a putative transcriptional regulator, and subsequent cell-based assays confirmed that PAMAM-NH2 caused NF-κB-dependent cell cycle arrest. However, PAMAM-NH2 did not affect cell cycle progression in the human A549 adenocarcinoma cell line. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying systems biology approaches to predict cellular responses to nanomaterials and highlight the importance of using relevant (primary) cell models.",

    "title": "High expression of glycolytic and pigment proteins is associated with worse clinical outcome in stage III melanoma.",
    "abstract": "There are insufficient numbers of prognostic factors available for prediction of clinical outcome in patients with stage III malignant cutaneous melanoma, even when known adverse pathological risk factors, such as macrometastasis, number of lymph node metastases, and ulceration are taken into consideration. The aim of this study was therefore to identify additional prognostic factors to better predict patients with a high risk of relapse, thus enabling us to better determine the need for adjuvant treatment in stage III disease. An RNA oligonucleotide microarray study was performed on first regional lymph node metastases in 42 patients with stage III melanoma: 23 patients with short-term survival (≤ 13 months) and 19 with long-term survival (≥ 60 months), to identify genes associated with clinical outcome. Candidate genes were validated by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Several gene ontology (GO) categories were highly significantly differentially expressed including glycolysis (GO: 0006096; P<0.001) and the pigment biosynthetic process (GO: 0046148; P<0.001), in which overexpression was associated with short-disease-specific survival. Three overexpressed glycolytic genes, GAPDHS, GAPDH, and PKM2, and two pigment-related genes, TYRP1 and OCA2, were selected for validation. A significant difference in GAPDHS protein expression between short- and long-term survivors (P=0.021) and a trend for PKM2 (P=0.093) was observed in univariate analysis. Positive expression of at least two of four proteins (GAPDHS, GAPDH, PKM2, TYRP1) in immunohistochemical analysis was found to be an independent adverse prognostic factor for disease-specific survival (P=0.011). Our results indicate that this prognostic panel in combination with established risk factors may contribute to an improved prediction of patients with a high risk of relapse.",

    "title": "A Comprehensive Sequencing-Based Analysis of Allelic Methylation Patterns in Hemostatic Genes in Human Liver",
    "abstract": "Characterizing the relationship between genetic, epigenetic (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] methylation), and transcript variation could provide insights into mechanisms regulating hemostasis and potentially identify new drug targets. Several hemostatic factors are synthesized in the liver, yet high-resolution DNA methylation data from human liver tissue is currently lacking for these genes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can influence DNA methylation in cis which can affect gene expression. This can be analyzed through allele-specific methylation (ASM) experiments. We performed targeted genomic DNA- and bisulfite-sequencing of 35 hemostatic genes in human liver samples for SNP and DNA methylation analysis, respectively, and integrated the data for ASM determination. ASM-associated SNPs (ASM-SNPs) were tested for association to gene expression in liver using in-house generated ribonucleic acid-sequencing data. We then assessed whether ASM-SNPs associated with gene expression, plasma proteins, or other traits relevant for hemostasis using publicly available data. We identified 112 candidate ASM-SNPs. Of these, 68% were associated with expression of their respective genes in human liver or in other human tissues and 54% were associated with the respective plasma protein levels, activity, or other relevant hemostatic genome-wide association study traits such as venous thromboembolism, coronary artery disease, stroke, and warfarin dose maintenance. Our study provides the first detailed map of the DNA methylation landscape and ASM analysis of hemostatic genes in human liver tissue, and suggests that methylation regulated by genetic variants in cis may provide a mechanistic link between noncoding SNPs and variation observed in circulating hemostatic proteins, prothrombotic diseases, and drug response.",

    "abstract": "The use of progestins has resulted in contamination of aquatic environments and some progestins have in experimental studies been shown to impair reproduction in fish and amphibians at low ng L(-1) concentrations. The mechanisms underlying their reproductive toxicity are largely unknown. Some progestins, such as levonorgestrel (LNG), exert androgenic effects in mammals by activating the androgen receptor (AR). Male three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) kidneys produce spiggin, a gluelike glycoprotein used in nest building, and its production is directly governed by androgens. Spiggin is normally absent in females but its production in female kidneys can be induced by AR agonists. Spiggin serves as the best known biomarker for androgens in fish. We exposed adult female sticklebacks to LNG at 5.5, 40, and 358 ng L(-1) for 21 days. Androgenic effects were found at LNG concentrations ≥40 ng L(-1) including induction of spiggin transcription, kidney hypertrophy, and suppressed liver vitellogenin transcription. These are the first in vivo quantitative data showing that LNG is a potent androgen in fish supporting the contention that androgenic effects of certain progestins contribute to their reproductive toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) compose between 40% and 50% of all adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. In this clinically diverse group, molecular aberrations, such as FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations, recently have added to the prognostic accuracy. Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer, including AML. We investigated in total 118 CN-AML samples in a test and a validation cohort for genome-wide promoter DNA methylation with Illumina Methylation Bead arrays and compared them with normal myeloid precursors and global gene expression. IDH and NPM1 mutations were associated with different methylation patterns (P = .0004 and .04, respectively). Genome-wide methylation levels were elevated in IDH-mutated samples (P = .006). We observed a negative impact of DNA methylation on transcription. Genes targeted by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and genes associated with bivalent histone marks in stem cells showed increased aberrant methylation in AML (P < .0001). Furthermore, high methylation levels of PcG target genes were independently associated with better progression-free survival (odds ratio = 0.47, P = .01) and overall survival (odds ratio = 0.36, P = .001). In summary, genome-wide methylation patterns show preferential methylation of PcG targets with prognostic impact in CN-AML.",

Hitherto, no studies demonstrate a role for this amine in human islet function, nor is it known if 5-HT signaling is involved in the development of beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D). To clarify this, we performed a complete transcriptional mapping of 5-HT receptors and processing enzymes in human islets and investigated differential expression of these genes in non-diabetic and T2D human islet donors. We show the expression of fourteen 5-HT receptors as well as processing enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 5-HT at the mRNA level in human islets. Two 5-HT receptors (HTR1D and HTR2A) were over-expressed in T2D islet donors. Both receptors (5-HT1d and 5-HT2a) were localized to human alpha, beta and delta cells. 5-HT inhibited both insulin and glucagon secretion in non-diabetic islet donors. In islets isolated from T2D donors the amine significantly increased release of insulin in response to glucose. Our results suggest that 5-HT signaling participates in regulation of overall islet hormone secretion in non- diabetic individuals and over-expression of HTR1D and HTR2A may either contribute to islet dysfunction in T2D or arise as a consequence of an already dysfunctional islet.",

    "abstract": "Between 1992 and 2008, 713 high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemias in children aged 1-15 years were diagnosed and treated according to the Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1992/2000 protocols. Twenty (2.8%) harbored t(1;19), t(9;22), der(11q23), or t(12;21). The median age of patients with \"classic\" high hyperdiploidy was lower than that of patients with translocation-positive high hyperdiploidy (P<0.001). Cases with triple trisomies (+4, +10, +17), comprising 50%, had higher modal numbers than the triple trisomy-negative cases (P<0.0001). The probabilities of event-free survival and overall survival were lower for those with white blood cell counts ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L (P=0.017/P=0.009), ≥ 5% bone marrow blasts at day 29 (P=0.001/0.002), and for high-risk patients (P<0.001/P=0.003), whereas event-free, but not overall, survival, was higher for cases with gains of chromosomes 4 (P<0.0001), 6 (P<0.003), 17 (P=0.010), 18 (P=0.049), and 22 (P=0.040), triple trisomies (P=0.002), and modal numbers >53/55 (P=0.020/0.024). In multivariate analyses, modal number and triple trisomies were significantly associated with superior event-free survival in separate analyses with age and white blood cell counts. When including both modal numbers and triple trisomies, only low white blood cell counts were significantly associated with superior event-free survival (P=0.009). We conclude that high modal chromosome numbers and triple trisomies are highly correlated prognostic factors and that these two parameters identify the same subgroup of patients characterized by a particularly favorable outcome.",

    "title": "Sensory receptor repertoire in cyprid antennules of the barnacle Balanus improvisus.",
    "abstract": "Barnacle settlement involves sensing of a variety of exogenous cues. A pair of antennules is the main sensory organ that the cyprid larva uses to explore the surface. Antennules are equipped with a number of setae that have both chemo- and mechanosensing function. The current study explores the repertoire of sensory receptors in Balanus improvisus cyprid antennules with the goal to better understand sensory systems involved in the settling behavior of this species. We carried out transcriptome sequencing of dissected B. improvisus cyprid antennules. The generated transcriptome assembly was used to search for sensory receptors using HMM models. Among potential chemosensory genes, we identified the ionotropic receptors IR25a, IR8a and IR93a, and several divergent IR candidates to be expressed in the cyprid antennules. We found one gustatory-like receptor but no odorant receptors, chemosensory or odorant-binding proteins. Apart from chemosensory receptors, we also identified 13 potential mechanosensory genes represented by several transient receptor potential channels (TRP) subfamilies. Furthermore, we analyzed changes in expression profiles of IRs and TRPs during the B. improvisus settling process. Several of the sensory genes were differentially expressed during the course of larval settlement. This study gives expanded knowledge about the sensory systems present in barnacles, a taxonomic group for which only limited information about receptors is currently available. It furthermore serves as a starting point for more in depth studies of how sensory signaling affects settling behavior in barnacles with implications for preventing biofouling.",

    "title": "High diagnostic yield in skeletal ciliopathies using massively parallel genome sequencing, structural variant screening and RNA analyses.",
    "abstract": "Skeletal ciliopathies are a heterogenous group of disorders with overlapping clinical and radiographic features including bone dysplasia and internal abnormalities. To date, pathogenic variants in at least 30 genes, coding for different structural cilia proteins, are reported to cause skeletal ciliopathies. Here, we summarize genetic and phenotypic features of 34 affected individuals from 29 families with skeletal ciliopathies. Molecular diagnostic testing was performed using massively parallel sequencing (MPS) in combination with copy number variant (CNV) analyses and in silico filtering for variants in known skeletal ciliopathy genes. We identified biallelic disease-causing variants in seven genes: DYNC2H1, KIAA0753, WDR19, C2CD3, TTC21B, EVC, and EVC2. Four variants located in non-canonical splice sites of DYNC2H1, EVC, and KIAA0753 led to aberrant splicing that was shown by sequencing of cDNA. Furthermore, CNV analyses showed an intragenic deletion of DYNC2H1 in one individual and a 6.7 Mb de novo deletion on chromosome 1q24q25 in another. In five unsolved cases, MPS was performed in family setting. In one proband we identified a de novo variant in PRKACA and in another we found a homozygous intragenic deletion of IFT74, removing the first coding exon and leading to expression of a shorter message predicted to result in loss of 40 amino acids at the N-terminus. These findings establish IFT74 as a new skeletal ciliopathy gene.

    "abstract": "Understanding the key processes that control bacterial community composition has enabled predictions of bacterial distribution and function within ecosystems. In this study, we used the Baltic Sea as a model system to quantify the phylogenetic signal of salinity and season with respect to bacterioplankton community composition. The abundances of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing reads were analyzed from samples obtained from similar geographic locations in July and February along a brackish to marine salinity gradient in the Baltic Sea. While there was no distinct pattern of bacterial richness at different salinities, the number of bacterial phylotypes in winter was significantly higher than in summer. Bacterial community composition in brackish vs. marine conditions, and in July vs. February was significantly different. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that bacterial community composition was primarily separated according to salinity and secondly according to seasonal differences at all taxonomic ranks tested. Similarly, quantitative phylogenetic clustering implicated a phylogenetic signal for both salinity and seasonality. Our results suggest that global patterns of bacterial community composition with respect to salinity and season are the result of phylogenetically clustered ecological preferences with stronger imprints from salinity.",

    "title": "Heterogeneous Hunter-Gatherer and Steppe-Related Ancestries in Late Neolithic and Bell Beaker Genomes from Present-Day France.",
    "abstract": "The transition from the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age has witnessed important population and societal changes in western Europe.1 These include massive genomic contributions of pastoralist herders originating from the Pontic-Caspian steppes2,3 into local populations, resulting from complex interactions between collapsing hunter-gatherers and expanding farmers of Anatolian ancestry.4-8 This transition is documented through extensive ancient genomic data from present-day Britain,9,10 Ireland,11,12 Iberia,13 Mediterranean islands,14,15 and Germany.8 It remains, however, largely overlooked in France, where most focus has been on the Middle Neolithic (n = 63),8,9,16 with the exception of one Late Neolithic genome sequenced at 0.05× coverage.16 This leaves the key transitional period covering ∼3,400-2,700 cal. years (calibrated years) BCE genetically unsampled and thus the exact time frame of hunter-gatherer persistence and arrival of steppe migrations unknown. To remediate this, we sequenced 24 ancient human genomes from France spanning ∼3,400-1,600 cal. years BCE. This reveals Late Neolithic populations that are genetically diverse and include individuals with dark skin, hair, and eyes. We detect heterogeneous hunter-gatherer ancestries within Late Neolithic communities, reaching up to ∼63.3% in some individuals, and variable genetic contributions of steppe herders in Bell Beaker populations. We provide an estimate as late as ∼3,800 years BCE for the admixture between Neolithic and Mesolithic populations and as early as ∼2,650 years BCE for the arrival of steppe-related ancestry. The genomic heterogeneity characterized underlines the complex history of human interactions even at the local scale.",

    "title": "Grey wolf genomic history reveals a dual ancestry of dogs.",
    "abstract": "The grey wolf (Canis lupus) was the first species to give rise to a domestic population, and they remained widespread throughout the last Ice Age when many other large mammal species went extinct. Little is known, however, about the history and possible extinction of past wolf populations or when and where the wolf progenitors of the present-day dog lineage (Canis familiaris) lived1-8. Here we analysed 72 ancient wolf genomes spanning the last 100,000 years from Europe, Siberia and North America. We found that wolf populations were highly connected throughout the Late Pleistocene, with levels of differentiation an order of magnitude lower than they are today. This population connectivity allowed us to detect natural selection across the time series, including rapid fixation of mutations in the gene IFT88 40,000-30,000 years ago. We show that dogs are overall more closely related to ancient wolves from eastern Eurasia than to those from western Eurasia, suggesting a domestication process in the east. However, we also found that dogs in the Near East and Africa derive up to half of their ancestry from a distinct population related to modern southwest Eurasian wolves, reflecting either an independent domestication process or admixture from local wolves. None of the analysed ancient wolf genomes is a direct match for either of these dog ancestries, meaning that the exact progenitor populations remain to be located.",

    "title": "Comprehensive transcriptome assessment in PBMCs of post-COVID patients at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild COVID infection reveals upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling and a prolonged immune response.",
    "abstract": "Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nWe analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol.\n\nWe identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent.\n\nOur findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.",

    "title": "Phylogenetic relationships of rollers (Coraciidae) based on complete mitochondrial genomes and fifteen nuclear genes.",
    "abstract": "The rollers (Coraciidae) constitute a relative small avian family with ca. 12 species distributed in Africa, western and southern Eurasia, and eastern Australia. In this study we examine the phylogenetic relationships of all species currently recognized in the family, including two taxa whose taxonomic status is currently contested. By using shotgun sequencing on degraded DNA from museum study skins we have been able to recover complete mitochondrial genomes as well as 15 nuclear genes for in total 16 taxa. The gene sequences were analyzed both concatenated in a maximum likelihood framework as well in a species tree approach using MP-EST. The different analytical approaches yield similar, highly supported trees and support the current division of the rollers into two genera, Coracias and Eurystomus. The only conflict relates to the placement of the Blue-bellied Roller (C. cyanogaster), where the mitochondrial, and the concatenated nuclear and mitochondrial data set, place this taxon as sister to the other Coracias species, whereas nuclear data and the species tree analysis place it as the sister taxon of C. naevia and C. spatulatus. All analyses place the Eurasian roller (C. garrulus) with the two African species, Abyssinian Roller (C. abyssinica) and Liliac-breasted Roller (C. caudatus), and place this clade as the sister group to the Asian Coracias rollers. In addition, our results support a sister group relationship between the morphologically rather dissimilar Purple Roller (C. naevia) and Racquet-tailed Roller (C. spatulatus) and also support the division of Eurystomus in an African and an Asian clade. However, within the Asian clade the Azure Roller (E. azureus) from Halmahera appears to be nested within the Dollarbird (E. orientalis), indicating that that this taxon is a morphological divergent, but a rather recent offshoot, of the widespread Dollarbird. Similarly, the Purple-winged Roller (C. temminickii) from Sulawesi group together with C. benghalensis affinis from Southeast Asia and these two in turn comprises the sister group to C. benghalensis benghalensis from India and western Asia.",

    "abstract": "Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are heterogeneous and complex conditions with overlapping clinical symptoms and elevated familial aggregation, which suggests the existence of a shared genetic component. In order to identify this genetic background in a systematic fashion, we performed the first cross-disease genome-wide meta-analysis in systemic seropositive rheumatic diseases, namely, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.\r\n\r\nWe meta-analysed ~6.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 11 678 cases and 19 704 non-affected controls of European descent populations. The functional roles of the associated variants were interrogated using publicly available databases.\r\n\r\nOur analysis revealed five shared genome-wide significant independent \r\n                loci that had not been previously associated with these diseases: NAB1, KPNA4-ARL14, DGQK, LIMK1 and PRR12. All of these loci are related with immune processes such as interferon and epidermal growth factor signalling, response to methotrexate, cytoskeleton dynamics and coagulation cascade. Remarkably, several of the associated loci are known key players in autoimmunity, which supports the validity of our results. All the associated variants showed significant functional enrichment in DNase hypersensitivity sites, chromatin states and histone marks in relevant immune cells, including shared expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, our results were significantly enriched in drugs that are being tested for the treatment of the diseases under study.\r\n\r\nWe have identified shared new risk \r\n                loci with functional value across diseases and pinpoint new potential candidate loci that could be further investigated. Our results highlight the potential of drug repositioning among related systemic seropositive rheumatic IMIDs.",

    "title": "Sequentially acting SOX proteins orchestrate astrocyte‐ and oligodendrocyte‐specific gene expression",
    "abstract": "SOX transcription factors have important roles during astrocyte and oligodendrocyte development, but how glial genes are specified and activated in a sub-lineage-specific fashion remains unknown. Here, we define glial-specific gene expression in the developing spinal cord using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Moreover, by ChIP-seq analyses we show that these glial gene sets are extensively preselected already in multipotent neural precursor cells through prebinding by SOX3. In the subsequent lineage-restricted glial precursor cells, astrocyte genes become additionally targeted by SOX9 at DNA regions strongly enriched for Nfi binding motifs. Oligodendrocyte genes instead are prebound by SOX9 only, at sites which during oligodendrocyte maturation are targeted by SOX10. Interestingly, reporter gene assays and functional studies in the spinal cord reveal that SOX3 binding represses the synergistic activation of astrocyte genes by SOX9 and NFIA, whereas oligodendrocyte genes are activated in a combinatorial manner by SOX9 and SOX10. These genome-wide studies demonstrate how sequentially expressed SOX proteins act on lineage-specific regulatory DNA elements to coordinate glial gene expression both in a temporal and in a sub-lineage-specific fashion.",

    "title": "Introgression of resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi L. from wild barley into cultivated barley facilitated by doubled haploid and molecular marker techniques.",
    "abstract": "Long-term pre-breeding using Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum as a donor of bird cherry-oat aphid resistance has resulted in agronomically improved resistance sources of barley along with easy-to-use molecular markers. Bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) is a pest and a virus vector in barley to which there are no bred-resistant cultivars. The present study describes how resistance from Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum has been introgressed in cultivated barley via five successive crosses with the same cultivar Lina (BC) and in parallel with other more modern barley cultivars. Most of the selections for resistance are based on measurements of individual aphid growth in the laboratory. This very slow phenotyping method has been complemented by molecular marker evaluation and application in part of the breeding material. Doubled haploid production in each generation has been crucial for more precise selection of lines with the quantitatively expressed resistance. A field trial of selected \"BC\n            3\"-generation lines essentially confirmed the laboratory results, so did genotyping of the whole pedigree of parents and selected \"BC2\" and \"BC4\" offspring lines. The Infinium iSelect 50 K SNP assay confirmed relationships between lines and discerned several new markers for a resistance QTL on chromosome 2H.",
