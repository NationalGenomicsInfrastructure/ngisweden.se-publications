    "title": "TGFβ signaling mediates microglial resilience to spatiotemporally restricted myelin degeneration.",
    "abstract": "Microglia survey and regulate central nervous system myelination during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. However, whether microglia-myelin interactions are spatiotemporally regulated remains unexplored. Here, by examining spinal cord white matter tracts in mice, we determined that myelin degeneration was particularly prominent in the dorsal column (DC) during normal aging. This was accompanied by molecular and functional changes in DC microglia as well as an upregulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF)β signaling. Disrupting TGFβ signaling in microglia led to unrestrained microglial responses and myelin loss in the DC, accompanied by neurological deficits exacerbated with aging. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analyses revealed the emergence of a TGFβ signaling-sensitive microglial subset and a disease-associated oligodendrocyte subset, both of which were spatially restricted to the DC. We further discovered that microglia rely on a TGFβ autocrine mechanism to prevent damage of myelin in the DC. These findings demonstrate that TGFβ signaling is crucial for maintaining microglial resilience to myelin degeneration in the DC during aging. This highlights a previously unresolved checkpoint mechanism of TGFβ signaling with regional specificity and spatially restricted microglia-oligodendrocyte interactions.",

    "title": "Integrative genetic characterization and phenotype correlations in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma tumours.",
    "abstract": "About 60% of Pheochromocytoma (PCC) and Paraganglioma (PGL) patients have either germline or somatic mutations in one of the 12 proposed disease causing genes; SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, VHL, EPAS1, RET, NF1, TMEM127, MAX and H-RAS. Selective screening for germline mutations is routinely performed in clinical management of these diseases. Testing for somatic alterations is not performed on a regular basis because of limitations in interpreting the results.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the study was to investigate genetic events and phenotype correlations in a large cohort of PCC and PGL tumours.\r\n\r\nA total of 101 tumours from 89 patients with PCC and PGL were re-sequenced for a panel of 10 disease causing genes using automated Sanger sequencing. Selected samples were analysed with Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification and/or SNParray.\r\n\r\nPathogenic genetic variants were found in tumours from 33 individual patients (37%), 14 (16%) were discovered in constitutional DNA and 16 (18%) were confirmed as somatic. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed in 1/1 SDHB, 11/11 VHL and 3/3 NF1-associated tumours. In patients with somatic mutations there were no recurrences in contrast to carriers of germline mutations (P = 0.022). SDHx/VHL/EPAS1 associated cases had higher norepinephrine output (P = 0.03) and lower epinephrine output (P<0.001) compared to RET/NF1/H-RAS cases.\r\n\r\nSomatic mutations are frequent events in PCC and PGL tumours. Tumour genotype may be further investigated as prognostic factors in these diseases. Growing evidence suggest that analysis of tumour DNA could have an impact on the management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Biooxidation of gold-bearing refractory mineral ores such as arsenopyrite (FeAsS) in stirred tanks produces solutions containing highly toxic arsenic concentrations. In this study, ferrous iron and inorganic sulfur-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus strain IBUN Ppt12 most similar to Acidithiobacillus ferrianus and inorganic sulfur compound oxidizing Acidithiobacillus sp. IBUNS3 were grown in co-culture during biooxidation of refractory FeAsS. Total RNA was extracted and sequenced from the planktonic cells to reveal genes with different transcript counts involved in the response to FeAsS containing medium. The co-culture's response to arsenic release during biooxidation included the ars operon genes that were independently regulated according to the arsenopyrite concentration. Additionally, increased mRNA transcript counts were identified for transmembrane ion transport proteins, stress response mechanisms, accumulation of inorganic polyphosphates, urea catabolic processes, and tryptophan biosynthesis. Acidithiobacillus spp. RNA transcripts also included those encoding the Rus and PetI proteins involved in ferrous iron oxidation and gene clusters annotated as encoding inorganic sulfur compound metabolism enzymes. Finally, mRNA counts of genes related to DNA methylation, management of oxidative stress, chemotaxis, and motility during biooxidation were decreased compared to cells growing without mineral. The results provide insights into the adaptation of Acidithiobacillus spp. to growth during biooxidation of arsenic-bearing sulfides.",

    "title": "Diel Bacterioplankton Community Dynamics Under Contrasting Light Regimes.",
    "abstract": "In the Boreal region, extreme seasonal variations in day-night length expose communities to dynamic light and temperature fluctuations. Freshwater bacterioplankton, representing key ecosystem components, faces climate-driven shifts; yet the fixed day-length patterns determined by latitude underscore the importance of studying light's role in predicting ecosystem responses. We investigated bacterial community composition in a brown peat bog and a clear oligotrophic lake across seasons with contrasting light regimes: the summer solstice (> 20 h of daylight) and the autumn equinox (equal day-night length). Using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA transcripts, alongside measurements of physicochemical parameters, organic matter characterisation and dissolved carbon dioxide and methane gas measurements, we found no diel cycling in the lake during either period or in the peat bog near the summer solstice. However, the structure of bacterial peat bog communities exhibited cyclic changes over diel cycles at the autumn equinox. Twelve amplicon sequence variants, including both phototrophic and heterotrophic taxa, increased in abundance at all measured morning sampling times. These findings provide valuable insights into the diel patterns of boreal lentic habitats and their bacterioplankton communities, highlighting the absence of diel fluctuations in some systems and seasons, while revealing cyclic dynamics in others, driven by conditionally rare taxa.",

    "title": "Type 2 diabetes and obesity induce similar transcriptional reprogramming in human myocytes.",
    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is one of the primary tissues involved in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The close association between obesity and T2D makes it difficult to isolate specific effects attributed to the disease alone. Therefore, here we set out to identify and characterize intrinsic properties of myocytes, associated independently with T2D or obesity.\n\nWe generated and analyzed RNA-seq data from primary differentiated myotubes from 24 human subjects, using a factorial design (healthy/T2D and non-obese/obese), to determine the influence of each specific factor on genome-wide transcription. This setup enabled us to identify intrinsic properties, originating from muscle precursor cells and retained in the corresponding myocytes. Bioinformatic and statistical methods, including differential expression analysis, gene-set analysis, and metabolic network analysis, were used to characterize the different myocytes.\n\nWe found that the transcriptional program associated with obesity alone was strikingly similar to that induced specifically by T2D. We identified a candidate epigenetic mechanism, H3K27me3 histone methylation, mediating these transcriptional signatures. T2D and obesity were independently associated with dysregulated myogenesis, down-regulated muscle function, and up-regulation of inflammation and extracellular matrix components. Metabolic network analysis identified that in T2D but not obesity a specific metabolite subnetwork involved in sphingolipid metabolism was transcriptionally regulated.\n\nOur findings identify inherent characteristics in myocytes, as a memory of the in vivo phenotype, without the influence from a diabetic or obese extracellular environment, highlighting their importance in the development of T2D.",

    "abstract": "Terpenes constitute a major part of secondary metabolites secreted by plants in the rhizosphere. However, their specific functions in fungal-plant interactions have not been investigated thoroughly. In this study we investigated the role of monoterpenes in interactions between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and the soilborne pathogen Verticillium longisporum. We identified seven monoterpenes produced by B. napus, and production of α-pinene, β-pinene, 3-carene, and camphene was significantly increased upon fungal infection. Among them, β-pinene was chosen for further analysis. Transcriptome analysis of V. longisporum on exposure to β-pinene resulted in identification of two highly expressed pleotropic drug transporters paralog genes named VlAbcG1a and VlAbcG1b. Overexpression of VlAbcG1a in Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased tolerance to β-pinene, while deletion of the VlAbcG1a homologous gene in Verticillium dahliae resulted in mutants with increased sensitivity to certain monoterpenes. Furthermore, the VlAbcG1a overexpression strain displayed an increased tolerance to β-pinene and increased virulence in tomato plants. Data from this study give new insights into the roles of terpenes in plant-fungal pathogen interactions and the mechanisms fungi deploy to cope with the toxicity of these secondary metabolites.",

    "title": "Balanced chromosomal rearrangements implicate YIPF5 and SPATC1L in non-obstructive oligoasthenozoospermia and oligozoospermia and of a derivative chromosome 22 in recurrent miscarriage.",
    "abstract": "Naturally occurring balanced, unbalanced, and complex chromosomal rearrangements have been reported to cause pathogenic genomic or genetic variants leading to infertility and recurrent miscarriage. Therefore, balanced chromosomal rearrangements were used as genomic signposts for identification of candidate genes or genomic loci associated with male infertility due to defects of spermatogenesis, or with recurrent miscarriage. In three male probands, structural chromosomal variants and copy number variants were identified at nucleotide resolution by long-insert genome sequencing approaches and Sanger sequencing. The pathogenic potential of these and affected candidate genes was assessed based on convergent genomic and genotype-phenotype correlation data. Identification of balanced chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints and interpretation in the context of their genomic background of structural and copy number variants led us to conclude that the infertility due to oligoasthenozoospermia and oligozoospermia is most likely associated with a position effect on YIPF5 and SPATC1L, respectively. In a third proband with intellectual disability and recurrent miscarriage, disruption of CAMK2B causing autosomal dominant, intellectual developmental disorder 54 and increased meiotic segregation during gametogenesis of a der(22) are responsible for the reported phenotype. Our data further support the existence of loci at 5q23 and 21q22.3 for these spermatogenesis defects and highlight the importance of the naturally occurring balanced chromosomal rearrangements for assessment of the pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, we show comorbidities due to the same balanced chromosomal rearrangement caused by different pathogenic mechanisms.",

Genetic investigation using polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed homozygosity for a region spanning the HYPT7 locus on chromosome 3 in affected individuals of all five families. Sequence analysis of the LIPH gene revealed a novel nonsense mutation (p.Arg260X) associated with hypotrichosis without woolly hair in one family.

    "title": "Translating GWAS-identified loci for cardiac rhythm and rate using an in vivo image- and CRISPR/Cas9-based approach",
    "abstract": "A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified eight loci that are associated with heart rate variability (HRV), but candidate genes in these loci remain uncharacterized. We developed an image- and CRISPR/Cas9-based pipeline to systematically characterize candidate genes for HRV in live zebrafish embryos. Nine zebrafish orthologues of six human candidate genes were targeted simultaneously in eggs from fish that transgenically express GFP on smooth muscle cells (Tg[acta2:GFP]), to visualize the beating heart. An automated analysis of repeated 30 s recordings of beating atria in 381 live, intact zebrafish embryos at 2 and 5 days post-fertilization highlighted genes that influence HRV (hcn4 and si:dkey-65j6.2 [KIAA1755]); heart rate (rgs6 and hcn4); and the risk of sinoatrial pauses and arrests (hcn4). Exposure to 10 or 25 µM ivabradine-an open channel blocker of HCNs-for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent higher HRV and lower heart rate at 5 days post-fertilization. Hence, our screen confirmed the role of established genes for heart rate and rhythm (RGS6 and HCN4); showed that ivabradine reduces heart rate and increases HRV in zebrafish embryos, as it does in humans; and highlighted a novel gene that plays a role in HRV (KIAA1755).",

    "abstract": "Rearrangements of chromosome arm 15q are rare but recurrent in conventional lipomas, a tumor type often showing deregulated expression of the HMGA2 gene. In order to assess whether 15q rearrangements could constitute a distinct pathogenetic mechanism, we studied seven cases of conventional lipoma that at G-banding analysis had various rearrangements of 15q12-q21. The breakpoints in 15q were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses, and the status of the HMGA2 gene was evaluated by FISH and/or quantitative PCR. We found an overlapping deletion on 15q in two cases, but no recurring breakpoint among the other cases. In addition, all cases displayed rearrangement of HMGA2 at the genomic or the transcriptional level. Although 15q rearrangements sometimes are noted as the sole aberration at cytogenetic analysis of conventional lipomas, they are secondary to HMGA2 deregulation.",

    "title": "Metagenomic de novo assembly of an aquatic representative of the verrucomicrobial class Spartobacteria.",
    "abstract": "The verrucomicrobial subdivision 2 class Spartobacteria is one of the most abundant bacterial lineages in soil and has recently also been found to be ubiquitous in aquatic environments. A 16S rRNA gene study from samples spanning the entire salinity range of the Baltic Sea indicated that, in the pelagic brackish water, a phylotype of the Spartobacteria is one of the dominating bacteria during summer. Phylogenetic analyses of related 16S rRNA genes indicate that a purely aquatic lineage within the Spartobacteria exists. Since no aquatic representative from the Spartobacteria has been cultured or sequenced, the metabolic capacity and ecological role of this lineage are yet unknown. In this study, we reconstructed the genome and metabolic potential of the abundant Baltic Sea Spartobacteria phylotype by metagenomics. Binning of genome fragments by nucleotide composition and a self-organizing map recovered the near-complete genome of the organism, the gene content of which suggests an aerobic heterotrophic metabolism. Notably, we found 23 glycoside hydrolases that likely allow the use of a variety of carbohydrates, like cellulose, mannan, xylan, chitin, and starch, as carbon sources. In addition, a complete pathway for sulfate utilization was found, indicating catabolic processing of sulfated polysaccharides, commonly found in aquatic phytoplankton. The high frequency of glycoside hydrolase genes implies an important role of this organism in the aquatic carbon cycle. Spatiotemporal data of the phylotype's distribution within the Baltic Sea indicate a connection to Cyanobacteria that may be the main source of the polysaccharide substrates.",

    "title": "Ecological genomics in the Northern krill uncovers loci for local adaptation across ocean basins.",
    "abstract": "Krill are vital as food for many marine animals but also impacted by global warming. To learn how they and other zooplankton may adapt to a warmer world we studied local adaptation in the widespread Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica). We assemble and characterize its large genome and compare genome-scale variation among 74 specimens from the colder Atlantic Ocean and warmer Mediterranean Sea. The 19 Gb genome likely evolved through proliferation of retrotransposons, now targeted for inactivation by extensive DNA methylation, and contains many duplicated genes associated with molting and vision. Analysis of 760 million SNPs indicates extensive homogenizing gene-flow among populations. Nevertheless, we detect signatures of adaptive divergence across hundreds of genes, implicated in photoreception, circadian regulation, reproduction and thermal tolerance, indicating polygenic adaptation to light and temperature. The top gene candidate for ecological adaptation was nrf-6, a lipid transporter with a Mediterranean variant that may contribute to early spring reproduction. Such variation could become increasingly important for fitness in Atlantic stocks. Our study underscores the widespread but uneven distribution of adaptive variation, necessitating characterization of genetic variation among natural zooplankton populations to understand their adaptive potential, predict risks and support ocean conservation in the face of climate change.",

    "title": "Microevolution during an Anthrax outbreak leading to clonal heterogeneity and penicillin resistance.",
    "abstract": "Anthrax is a bacterial disease primarily affecting grazing animals but it can also cause severe disease in humans. We have used genomic epidemiology to study microevolution of the bacterium in a confined outbreak in cattle which involved emergence of an antibiotic-resistant phenotype. At the time of death, the animals contained a heterogeneous population of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), some being clonal but most being subclonal. We found that independent isolates from the same carcass had similar levels of SNV differences as isolates from different animals. Furthermore the relative levels of subclonal populations were different in different locations in the same carcass. The heterogeneity appeared to be derived in part from heterogeneity in the infectious dose. The resistance phenotype was linked to clonal mutations in an anti-sigma factor gene and in one case was preceded by an acquisition of a hypermutator phenotype. In another animal, small subclonal populations were observed with counteracting mutations that had turned off the resistance genes. In summary, this study shows the importance of accounting for both acquired and inherited heterogeneity when doing high-resolution infection tracing and when estimating the risks associated with penicillin treatment.",

    "abstract": "Polysome-profiling is commonly used to study translatomes and applies laborious extraction of efficiently translated mRNA (associated with >3 ribosomes) from a large volume across many fractions. This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for efficiently translated mRNA in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10-fold. The technique generates polysome-associated RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material and, when coupled with smart-seq2 single-cell RNA sequencing, translatomes in small tissues from biobanks can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved HCT-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associates with changes in mRNA abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in mRNA levels are buffered at the level of mRNA translation. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in biobanks.",

    "abstract": "Correct timing of neurogenesis is crucial for generating the correct number and subtypes of glia and neurons in the embryo, and for preventing tumours and stem cell depletion in the adults. Here, we analyse how the midbrain dopamine (mDA) neuron progenitors transition into cell cycle arrest (G0) and begin to mature into ependymal cells. Comparison of mDA progenitors from different embryonic stages revealed upregulation of the genes encoding Sox9 and nuclear factor I transcription factors during development. Their conditional inactivation in the early embryonic midbrain led to delayed G0 entry and ependymal maturation in the entire midbrain ventricular zone, reduced gliogenesis and increased generation of neurons, including mDA neurons. In contrast, their inactivation in late embryogenesis did not result in mitotic re-entry, suggesting that these factors are necessary for G0 induction, but not for its maintenance. Our characterisation of adult ependymal cells by single-cell RNA sequencing and histology show that mDA-progenitor-derived cells retain several progenitor features but also secrete neuropeptides and contact neighbouring cells and blood vessels, indicating that these cells may form part of the circumventricular organ system.",

    "abstract": "The New World Vulture [Coragyps] occidentalis (L. Miller, 1909) is one of many species that were extinct by the end of the Pleistocene. To understand its evolutionary history we sequenced the genome of a 14,000 year old [Coragyps] occidentalis found associated with megaherbivores in the Peruvian Andes. occidentalis has been viewed as the ancestor, or possibly sister, to the extant Black Vulture Coragyps atratus, but genomic data shows occidentalis to be deeply nested within the South American clade of atratus. Coragyps atratus inhabits lowlands, but the fossil record indicates that occidentalis mostly occupied high elevations. Our results suggest that occidentalis evolved from a population of atratus in southwestern South America that colonized the High Andes 300 to 400 kya. The morphological and morphometric differences between occidentalis and atratus may thus be explained by ecological diversification following from the natural selection imposed by this new and extreme, high elevation environment. The sudden evolution of a population with significantly larger body size and different anatomical proportions than atratus thus constitutes an example of punctuated evolution.",

    "title": "Gene co-expression network connectivity is an important determinant of selective constraint.",
    "abstract": "While several studies have investigated general properties of the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression, few of these have considered natural, outbreeding populations. In parallel, systems biology has established that a general feature of biological networks is that they are scale-free, rendering them buffered against random mutations. To date, few studies have attempted to examine the relationship between the selective processes acting to maintain natural variation of gene expression and the associated co-expression network structure. Here we utilised RNA-Sequencing to assay gene expression in winter buds undergoing bud flush in a natural population of Populus tremula, an outbreeding forest tree species. We performed expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping and identified 164,290 significant eQTLs associating 6,241 unique genes (eGenes) with 147,419 unique SNPs (eSNPs). We found approximately four times as many local as distant eQTLs, with local eQTLs having significantly higher effect sizes. eQTLs were primarily located in regulatory regions of genes (UTRs or flanking regions), regardless of whether they were local or distant. We used the gene expression data to infer a co-expression network and investigated the relationship between network topology, the genetic architecture of gene expression and signatures of selection. Within the co-expression network, eGenes were underrepresented in network module cores (hubs) and overrepresented in the periphery of the network, with a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and network connectivity. We additionally found that module core genes have experienced stronger selective constraint on coding and non-coding sequence, with connectivity associated with signatures of selection. Our integrated genetics and genomics results suggest that purifying selection is the primary mechanism underlying the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression assayed in flushing leaf buds of P. tremula and that connectivity within the co-expression network is linked to the strength of purifying selection.",

    "title": "Global genome splicing analysis reveals an increased number of alternatively spliced genes with aging.",
    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism for the development of different tissues; however, not much is known about changes to alternative splicing during aging. Splicing events may become more frequent and widespread genome-wide as tissues age and the splicing machinery stringency decreases. Using skin, skeletal muscle, bone, thymus, and white adipose tissue from wild-type C57BL6/J male mice (4 and 18 months old), we examined the effect of age on splicing by AS analysis of the differential exon usage of the genome. The results identified a considerable number of AS genes in skeletal muscle, thymus, bone, and white adipose tissue between the different age groups (ranging from 27 to 246 AS genes corresponding to 0.3-3.2% of the total number of genes analyzed). For skin, skeletal muscle, and bone, we included a later age group (28 months old) that showed that the number of alternatively spliced genes increased with age in all three tissues (P < 0.01). Analysis of alternatively spliced genes across all tissues by gene ontology and pathway analysis identified 158 genes involved in RNA processing. Additional analysis of AS in a mouse model for the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome was performed. The results show that expression of the mutant protein, progerin, is associated with an impaired developmental splicing. As progerin accumulates, the number of genes with AS increases compared to in wild-type skin. Our results indicate the existence of a mechanism for increased AS during aging in several tissues, emphasizing that AS has a more important role in the aging process than previously known.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variation (CNV) of the amyloid-β precursor protein gene (APP) is a known cause of autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD), but de novo genetic variants causing ADAD are rare. We report a mother and daughter with neuropathologically confirmed definite Alzheimer disease (AD) and extensive cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Copy number analysis identified an increased number of APP copies and genome sequencing (GS) revealed the underlying complex genomic rearrangement (CGR) including a triplication of APP with two unique breakpoint junctions (BPJs). The mosaic state in the mother had likely occurred de novo. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) on 42 different tissues, including 17 different brain regions, showed the derivative chromosome at varying mosaic levels (20-96%) in the mother who had symptom onset at age 58 years. In contrast, the derivative chromosome was present in all analyzed cells in the daughter whose symptom onset was at 34 years. This study reveals the architecture of a de novo CGR causing APP triplication and ADAD with a striking difference in age at onset between the fully heterozygous daughter compared to the mosaic mother. The GS analysis identified the complexity of the CGR illustrating its usefulness in identifying structural variants (SVs) in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "Oral-gut microbiome interactions in advanced cirrhosis: characterisation of pathogenic enterotypes and salivatypes, virulence factors and antimicrobial.",
    "abstract": "Cirrhosis complications are often triggered by bacterial infections with multidrug-resistant organisms. Alterations in the gut and oral microbiome in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) influence clinical outcomes. We interrogated: (i) gut and oral microbiome community structures, (ii) virulence factors (VFs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and (iii) oral-gut microbial overlap in patients with differing cirrhosis severity.\n\n15 healthy controls (HC), 26 stable cirrhosis (SC), 46 DC, 14 acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 14 with severe infection without cirrhosis (NLS) participated. Metagenomic sequencing was undertaken on paired saliva (S) and faecal (F) samples. 'Salivatypes' and 'enterotypes' based on genera clustering were assessed against cirrhosis severity and clinical parameters. VFs and ARGs were evaluated in oral and gut niches, and distinct resistotypes identified.\n\nSalivatypes and enterotypes revealed a greater proportion of pathobionts with concomitant reduction in autochthonous genera with increasing cirrhosis severity and hyperammonaemia. Increasing overlap between oral and gut microbiome communities was observed in DC and ACLF vs SC and HCs, independent of antimicrobial, beta-blocker and acid suppressant therapies. Two distinct gut microbiome clusters [ENT2/ENT3] harboured genes encoding for the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) system and other VFs in DC and ACLF. Substantial ARGs (oral: 1,218 and gut: 672) were detected [575 common to both sites]. The cirrhosis resistome was distinct, with three oral and four gut resistotypes identified, respectively.\n\nThe degree of oral-gut microbial community overlap, frequency of VFs and ARGs all increment significantly with cirrhosis severity, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. Despite similar antimicrobial exposure, patients with DC and ACLF have reduced microbial richness compared to NLS, supporting the additive pathobiological effect of cirrhosis.\n\nThis research underscores the crucial role of microbiome alterations in the progression of cirrhosis in an era of escalating multidrug resistant infections, highlighting the association and potential impact of increased oral-gut microbial overlap, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes on clinical outcomes. These findings are particularly significant for patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure, as they reveal the intricate relationship between microbiome alterations and cirrhosis complications. This is relevant in the context of multidrug-resistant organisms and reduced oral-gut microbial diversity that exacerbate cirrhosis severity, drive hepatic decompensation and complicate treatment. For practical applications, these insights could guide for cirrhosis patients the development of targeted microbiome-based therapeutics and personalised antimicrobial regimens to mitigate infectious complications to improve their clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A multidrug-resistant lineage of Staphylococcus epidermidis named ST215 is a common cause of prosthetic joint infections and other deep surgical site infections in Northern Europe, but is not present elsewhere. The increasing resistance among S. epidermidis strains is a global concern. We used whole-genome sequencing to characterize ST215 from healthcare settings.\n\nWe completed the genome of a ST215 isolate from a Swedish hospital using short and long reads, resulting in a circular 2,676,787 bp chromosome and a 2,326 bp plasmid. The new ST215 genome was placed in phylogenetic context using 1,361 finished public S. epidermidis reference genomes. We generated 10 additional short-read ST215 genomes and 11 short-read genomes of ST2, which is another common multidrug-resistant lineage at the same hospital. We studied recombination's role in the evolution of ST2 and ST215, and found multiple recombination events averaging 30-50 kb. By comparing the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing for 31 antimicrobial drugs with the genome content encoding antimicrobial resistance in the ST215 and ST2 isolates, we found highly similar resistance traits between the isolates, with 22 resistance genes being shared between all the ST215 and ST2 genomes. The ST215 genome contained 29 genes that were historically identified as virulence genes of S. epidermidis ST2. We established that in the nucleotide sequence stretches identified as recombination events, virulence genes were overrepresented in ST215, while antibiotic resistance genes were overrepresented in ST2.\n\nThis study features the extensive antibiotic resistance and virulence gene content in ST215 genomes. ST215 and ST2 lineages have similarly evolved, acquiring resistance and virulence through genomic recombination. The results highlight the threat of new multidrug-resistant S. epidermidis lineages emerging in healthcare settings.",

    "title": "Novel pathogenic genomic variants leading to autosomal dominant and recessive Robinow syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Robinow syndrome (RS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by skeletal dysplasia and a distinctive facial appearance. Previous studies have revealed locus heterogeneity with rare variants in DVL1, DVL3, FZD2, NXN, ROR2, and WNT5A underlying the etiology of RS. The aforementioned \"Robinow-associated genes\" and their gene products all play a role in the WNT/planar cell polarity signaling pathway. We performed gene-targeted Sanger sequencing, exome sequencing, genome sequencing, and array comparative genomic hybridization on four subjects with a clinical diagnosis of RS who had not had prior DNA testing. Individuals in our cohort were found to carry pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in three RS related genes: DVL1, ROR2, and NXN. One subject was found to have a nonsense variant (c.817C > T [p.Gln273*]) in NXN in trans with an ~1 Mb telomeric deletion on chromosome 17p containing NXN, which supports our contention that biallelic NXN variant alleles are responsible for a novel autosomal recessive RS locus. These findings provide increased understanding of the role of WNT signaling in skeletal development and maintenance. These data further support the hypothesis that dysregulation of the noncanonical WNT pathway in humans gives rise to RS.",

    "title": "Phylogenomic analysis of Stylops reveals the evolutionary history of a Holarctic Strepsiptera radiation parasitizing wild bees.",
    "abstract": "Holarctic Stylops is the largest genus of the enigmatic insect order Strepsiptera, twisted winged parasites. Members of Stylops are obligate endoparasites of Andrena mining bees and exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism typical of Strepsiptera. So far, molecular studies on Stylops have focused on questions on species delimitation. Here, we utilize the power of whole genome sequencing to infer the phylogeny of this morphologically challenging genus from thousands of loci. We use a species tree method, concatenated maximum likelihood analysis and Bayesian analysis with a relaxed clock model to reconstruct the phylogeny of 46 Stylops species, estimate divergence times, evaluate topological consistency across methods and infer the root position. Furthermore, the biogeographical history and coevolutionary patterns with host species are assessed. All methods recovered a well resolved topology with close to all nodes maximally supported and only a handful of minor topological variations. Based on the result, we find that included species can be divided into 12 species groups, seven of them including only Palaearctic species, three Nearctic and two were geographically mixed. We find a strongly supported root position between a clade formed by the spreta, thwaitesi and gwynanae species groups and the remaining species and that the sister group of Stylops is Eurystylops or Eurystylops + Kinzelbachus. Our results indicate that Stylops originated in the Western Palaearctic or Western Palaearctic and Nearctic in the early Neogene or late Paleogene, with four independent dispersal events to the Nearctic. Cophylogenetic analyses indicate that the diversification of Stylops has been shaped by both significant coevolution with the mining bee hosts and host-shifting. The well resolved and strongly supported phylogeny will provide a valuable phylogenetic basis for further studies into the fascinating world of Strepsipterans.",

    "title": "β-thymosins and hemocyte homeostasis in a crustacean.",
    "abstract": "Thymosin proteins are well known for their actin-binding activity. Thymosin beta 4 (Tβ4) has been associated with biological activities in tissue repair and cell migration via interaction with ATP-synthase in vertebrates, while the information of similar thymosin functions in invertebrates is limited. We have shown previously that ATP-synthase is present on the surface of crayfish hematopoietic tissue (HPT) cells, and that astakine 1 (Ast1, an invertebrate cytokine) was found to interact with this β-subunit of ATP synthase. Here, we identified five different β-thymosins from Pacifastacus leniusculus, designated Pl-β-thymosin1-5. The two dominant isoforms in brain, HPT and hemocytes, Pl-β-thymosin1 and 2, were chosen for functional studies. Both isoforms could bind to the β-subunit of ATP-synthase, and Pl-β-thymosin1, but not Pl-β-thymosin2, significantly increased extracellular ATP formation. Moreover, Pl-β-thymosin1 stimulated HPT cell migration in vitro and Ast1 blocked this effect. Pl-β-thymosin2 increased the circulating hemocyte number at an early stage after injection. Additionally, in vivo injection of Pl-β-thymosin1 resulted in significant reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in crayfish HPT whereas Pl-β-thymosin2 had a similar but transient effect. Both Pl-β-thymosins induced the expression of Ast1 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) transcripts, while silencing of endogenous Pl-β-thymosin 1 and 2 by RNAi resulted in significant reduction of the Ast1 and SOD transcripts. The diverse effects exhibited by Pl-β-thymosin1 and Pl-β-thymosin2 indicates that these proteins are involved in a complex interaction that regulates the hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Two C57BL/6 mice colonies maintained in two rooms of the same specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility were found to have different gut microbiota and a mucus phenotype that was specific for each colony. The thickness and growth of the colon mucus were similar in the two colonies. However, one colony had mucus that was impenetrable to bacteria or beads the size of bacteria-which is comparable to what we observed in free-living wild mice-whereas the other colony had an inner mucus layer penetrable to bacteria and beads. The different properties of the mucus depended on the microbiota, as they were transmissible by transfer of caecal microbiota to germ-free mice. Mice with an impenetrable mucus layer had increased amounts of Erysipelotrichi, whereas mice with a penetrable mucus layer had higher levels of Proteobacteria and TM7 bacteria in the distal colon mucus. Thus, our study shows that bacteria and their community structure affect mucus barrier properties in ways that can have implications for health and disease. It also highlights that genetically identical animals housed in the same facility can have rather distinct microbiotas and barrier structures.",

    "title": "DNA methylation variation in the brain of laying hens in relation to differential behavioral patterns.",
    "abstract": "Domesticated animals are unique to investigate the contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to specific phenotypes. Among non-genetic factors involved in phenotype formation are epigenetic mechanisms. Here we aimed to identify whether relative DNA methylation differences in the nidopallium between groups of individuals are among the non-genetic factors involved in the emergence of differential behavioral patterns in hens. The nidopallium was selected due to its important role in complex cognitive function (i.e., decision making) in birds. Behavioral patterns that spontaneously emerge in hens living in a highly controlled environment were identified with a unique tracking system that recorded their transitions between pen zones. Behavioral activity patterns were characterized through three classification schemes: (i) daily specific features of behavioral routines (Entropy), (ii) daily spatio-temporal activity patterns (Dynamic Time Warping), and (iii) social leading behavior (Leading Index). Unique differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between behavioral patterns emerging within classification schemes, with entropy having the higher number. Functionally, DTW had double the proportion of affected promoters and half of the distal intergenic regions. Pathway enrichment analysis of DMR-associated genes revealed that Entropy relates mainly to cell cycle checkpoints, Leading Index to mitochondrial function, and DTW to gene expression regulation. Our study suggests that different biological functions within neurons (particularly in the nidopallium) could be responsible for the emergence of distinct behavior patterns and that epigenetic variation within brain tissues would be an important factor to explain behavioral variation.",

    "title": "A novel RNA sequencing data analysis method for cell line authentication.",
    "abstract": "We have developed a novel analysis method that can interrogate the authenticity of biological samples used for generation of transcriptome profiles in public data repositories. The method uses RNA sequencing information to reveal mutations in expressed transcripts and subsequently confirms the identity of analysed cells by comparison with publicly available cell-specific mutational profiles. Cell lines constitute key model systems widely used within cancer research, but their identity needs to be confirmed in order to minimise the influence of cell contaminations and genetic drift on the analysis. Using both public and novel data, we demonstrate the use of RNA-sequencing data analysis for cell line authentication by examining the validity of COLO205, DLD1, HCT15, HCT116, HKE3, HT29 and RKO colorectal cancer cell lines. We successfully authenticate the studied cell lines and validate previous reports indicating that DLD1 and HCT15 are synonymous. We also show that the analysed HKE3 cells harbour an unexpected KRAS-G13D mutation and confirm that this cell line is a genuine KRAS dosage mutant, rather than a true isogenic derivative of HCT116 expressing only the wild type KRAS. This authentication method could be used to revisit the numerous cell line based RNA sequencing experiments available in public data repositories, analyse new experiments where whole genome sequencing is not available, as well as facilitate comparisons of data from different experiments, platforms and laboratories.",

    "title": "A small noncoding RNA links ribosome recovery and translation control to dedifferentiation during salamander limb regeneration.",
    "abstract": "Building a blastema from the stump is a key step of salamander limb regeneration. Stump-derived cells temporarily suspend their identity as they contribute to the blastema by a process generally referred to as dedifferentiation. Here, we provide evidence for a mechanism that involves an active inhibition of protein synthesis during blastema formation and growth. Relieving this inhibition results in a higher number of cycling cells and enhances the pace of limb regeneration. By small RNA profiling and fate mapping of skeletal muscle progeny as a cellular model for dedifferentiation, we find that the downregulation of miR-10b-5p is critical for rebooting the translation machinery. miR-10b-5p targets ribosomal mRNAs, and its artificial upregulation causes decreased blastema cell proliferation, reduction in transcripts that encode ribosomal subunits, diminished nascent protein synthesis, and retardation of limb regeneration. Taken together, our data identify a link between miRNA regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and protein synthesis during newt limb regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Steller's sea cow, an extinct sirenian and one of the largest Quaternary mammals, was described by Georg Steller in 1741 and eradicated by humans within 27 years. Here, we complement Steller's descriptions with paleogenomic data from 12 individuals. We identified convergent evolution between Steller's sea cow and cetaceans but not extant sirenians, suggesting a role of several genes in adaptation to cold aquatic (or marine) environments. Among these are inactivations of lipoxygenase genes, which in humans and mouse models cause ichthyosis, a skin disease characterized by a thick, hyperkeratotic epidermis that recapitulates Steller's sea cows' reportedly bark-like skin. We also found that Steller's sea cows' abundance was continuously declining for tens of thousands of years before their description, implying that environmental changes also contributed to their extinction.",

    "abstract": "Understanding genome evolution of polyploids requires dissection of their often highly similar subgenomes and haplotypes. Polyploid animal genome assemblies so far restricted homologous chromosomes to a 'collapsed' representation. Here, we sequenced the genome of the asexual Prussian carp, which is a close relative of the goldfish, and present a haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale assembly of a hexaploid animal. Genome-wide comparisons of the 150 chromosomes with those of two ancestral diploid cyprinids and the allotetraploid goldfish and common carp revealed the genomic structure, phylogeny and genome duplication history of its genome. It consists of 25 syntenic, homeologous chromosome groups and evolved by a recent autoploid addition to an allotetraploid ancestor. We show that de-polyploidization of the alloploid subgenomes on the individual gene level occurred in an equilibrated fashion. Analysis of the highly conserved actinopterygian gene set uncovered a subgenome dominance in duplicate gene loss of one ancestral chromosome set.",

    "title": "Low impact of Zostera marina meadows on sediment and water microbiota under brackish conditions.",
    "abstract": "Zostera marina is an important ecosystem engineer influencing shallow water environments and possibly shaping the microbiota in surrounding sediments and water. Z. marina is typically found in marine systems, but it can also proliferate under brackish conditions. Changes in salinity generally have a strong impact on the biota, especially at the salty divide between salinity 6 and 9. To better understand the impact of the salty divide on the interaction between Z. marina and the surrounding sediment and water microbiota, we investigated the effects of Z. marina meadows on the surrounding microbiota across a salinity range of 6-15 in the Baltic Sea during the summer using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.\n\nSalinity was the most important factor for structuring the microbiota within both water and sediment. The presence of Z. marina affected the composition of the bacterial and eukaryotic community and bacterial alpha diversity in the sediment. However, this effect was confined to alpha-mesohaline conditions (salinity 9-15). The impact of Z. marina below salinity 9 on water and sediment microbiota was insignificant.\n\nIncreasing salinity was associated with a longer leaf length of Z. marina, causing an increased canopy height, which affects the sediment microbiota through reduced water velocity. Hence, we propose that the canopy effect may be the major predictor explaining Z. marina's interactions with the surrounding microbiota at salinity 9-15. These findings emphasize the importance of the physical effects of Z. marina meadow ecosystem services and have important implications for Z. marina management under brackish conditions in a changing climate.",

    "title": "Genome of the avirulent human-infective trypanosome--Trypanosoma rangeli.",
    "abstract": "Trypanosoma rangeli is a hemoflagellate protozoan parasite infecting humans and other wild and domestic mammals across Central and South America. It does not cause human disease, but it can be mistaken for the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi. We have sequenced the T. rangeli genome to provide new tools for elucidating the distinct and intriguing biology of this species and the key pathways related to interaction with its arthropod and mammalian hosts.\n\nThe T. rangeli haploid genome is ∼ 24 Mb in length, and is the smallest and least repetitive trypanosomatid genome sequenced thus far. This parasite genome has shorter subtelomeric sequences compared to those of T. cruzi and T. brucei; displays intraspecific karyotype variability and lacks minichromosomes. Of the predicted 7,613 protein coding sequences, functional annotations could be determined for 2,415, while 5,043 are hypothetical proteins, some with evidence of protein expression. 7,101 genes (93%) are shared with other trypanosomatids that infect humans. An ortholog of the dcl2 gene involved in the T. brucei RNAi pathway was found in T. rangeli, but the RNAi machinery is non-functional since the other genes in this pathway are pseudogenized. T. rangeli is highly susceptible to oxidative stress, a phenotype that may be explained by a smaller number of anti-oxidant defense enzymes and heat-shock proteins.\n\nPhylogenetic comparison of nuclear and mitochondrial genes indicates that T. rangeli and T. cruzi are equidistant from T. brucei. In addition to revealing new aspects of trypanosome co-evolution within the vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, comparative genomic analysis with pathogenic trypanosomatids provides valuable new information that can be further explored with the aim of developing better diagnostic tools and/or therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Back pain is common in idiopathic scoliosis. The aim of this study was to study known genetic variants associated with pain in individuals with idiopathic scoliosis.\r\n\r\nWe included 1442 individuals with juvenile or adolescent idiopathic scoliosis from Sweden and Denmark. Single nucleotide variants (SNV) genotyping was performed on 37 SNVs. Pain was assessed using 2 questionnaires. The mean pain domain score on the Scoliosis Research Society 22 revised questionnaire (SRS-22r) ranging between 1 (worst) and 5 (best) was dichotomized into a \"back pain group\" (score <4) and a \"no back pain group\" (score ≥4). The EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) 3 level pain domain was dichotomized into a \"no pain group\" and a \"pain group.\" Odds ratios were used to describe the associations.\r\n\r\nBased on the SRS-22r pain domain scores, 456 individuals (32%) reported back pain. Based on the EQ-5D questionnaire, 813 individuals (56%) reported moderate or extreme pain/discomfort. The odds ratio for the associations between the selected genetic variants and back pain or pain in general as measured with SRS-22r and EQ-5D-3L ranged between 0.88 to 1.17 and 0.86 to 1.16, with P-values ranging between 0.08 to 0.99 and 0.08 to 0.95.\r\n\r\nThis study suggests that known genetic variants associated with pain do not play a significant role in the development of pain in individuals with idiopathic scoliosis.",

    "title": "Defining short linear motif binding determinants by phage display-based deep mutational scanning.",
    "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning (DMS) has emerged as a powerful approach for evaluating the effects of mutations on binding or function. Here, we developed a DMS by phage display protocol to define the specificity determinants of short linear motifs (SLiMs) binding to peptide-binding domains. We first designed a benchmarking DMS library to evaluate the performance of the approach on well-known ligands for 11 different peptide-binding domains, including the talin-1 PTB domain, the G3BP1 NTF2 domain, and the MDM2 SWIB domain. Comparison with a set of reference motifs from the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) database confirmed that the DMS by phage display analysis correctly identifies known motif binding determinants and provides novel insights into specificity determinants, including defining a non-canonical talin-1 PTB binding motif with a putative extended conformation. A second DMS library was designed, aiming to provide information on the binding determinants for 19 SLiM-based interactions between human and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The analysis confirmed the affinity determining residues of viral peptides binding to host proteins and refined the consensus motifs in human peptides binding to five domains from SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the non-structural protein (NSP) 9. The DMS analysis further pinpointed mutations that increased the affinity of ligands for NSP3 and NSP9. An affinity-improved cell-permeable NSP9-binding peptide was found to exert stronger antiviral effects than the wild-type peptide. Our study demonstrates that DMS by phage display can efficiently be multiplexed and applied to refine binding determinants and shows how the results can guide peptide-engineering efforts.",

    "title": "Characterizing single extracellular vesicles by droplet barcode sequencing for protein analysis.",
    "abstract": "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have in recent years evolved as a source of biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutic follow up. sEV samples derived from multicellular organisms exhibit a high heterogeneous repertoire of vesicles which current methods based on ensemble measurements cannot capture. In this work we present droplet barcode sequencing for protein analysis (DBS-Pro) to profile surface proteins on individual sEVs, facilitating identification of sEV-subtypes within and between samples. The method allows for analysis of multiple proteins through use of DNA barcoded affinity reagents and sequencing as readout. High throughput single vesicle profiling is enabled through compartmentalization of individual sEVs in emulsion droplets followed by droplet barcoding through PCR. In this proof-of-concept study we demonstrate that DBS-Pro allows for analysis of single sEVs, with a mixing rate below 2%. A total of over 120,000 individual sEVs obtained from a NSCLC cell line and from malignant pleural effusion (MPE) fluid of NSCLC patients have been analyzed based on their surface proteins. We also show that the method enables single vesicle surface protein profiling and by extension characterization of sEV-subtypes, which is essential to identify the cellular origin of vesicles in heterogenous samples.",

    "title": "The mitochondrial and autosomal mutation landscapes of prostate cancer.",
    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men. PCa is strongly age associated; low death rates in surveillance cohorts call into question the widespread use of surgery, which leads to overtreatment and a reduction in quality of life. There is a great need to increase the understanding of tumor characteristics in the context of disease progression.\n\nTo perform the first multigenome investigation of PCa through analysis of both autosomal and mitochondrial DNA, and to integrate exome sequencing data, and RNA sequencing and copy-number alteration (CNA) data to investigate how various different tumor characteristics, commonly analyzed separately, are interconnected.\n\nExome sequencing was applied to 64 tumor samples from 55 PCa patients with varying stage and grade. Integrated analysis was performed on a core set of 50 tumors from which exome sequencing, CNA, and RNA sequencing data were available.\n\nGenes, mutated at a significantly higher rate relative to a genomic background, were identified. In addition, mitochondrial and autosomal mutation rates were correlated to CNAs and proliferation, assessed as a cell cycle gene expression signature.\n\nGenes not previously reported to be significantly mutated in PCa, such as cell division cycle 27 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (CDC27), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A), and kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) were identified. The mutation rate in the mitochondrial genome was 55 times higher than that of the autosomes. Multilevel analysis demonstrated a tight correlation between high reactive-oxygen exposure, chromosomal damage, high proliferation, and in parallel, a transition from multiclonal indolent primary PCa to monoclonal aggressive disease. As we only performed targeted sequence analysis; copy-number neutral rearrangements recently described for PCa were not accounted for.\n\nThe mitochondrial genome displays an elevated mutation rate compared to the autosomal chromosomes. By integrated analysis, we demonstrated that different tumor characteristics are interconnected, providing an increased understanding of PCa etiology.",

    "abstract": "Immune aplastic anemia (AA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder driven by an autoimmune T cell attack against hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the exact autoantigen targets and role of other immune cells in the pathogenesis of AA are unknown. Here, we analyzed a cohort of 218 patients with AA using single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) αβ sequencing, TCRβ sequencing, flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine profiling. We identified natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ terminally differentiated effector T (TEMRA) cells expressing NK receptors with AA-associated TCRβ motifs as the most dysregulated immune cell populations in AA bone marrow. Functional coculture experiments using primary HSPCs and immune cells showed that NK cells cannot kill HSPCs alone but may sensitize HSPCs to CD8+ T cell-mediated killing through production of interferons. Furthermore, HSPCs induced activation of T cell clones with CD8+ TEMRA NK-like phenotype in coculture. Our results reveal a convergent phenotype of innate and adaptive immune cells that may drive AA.",

    "title": "Multifactorial analysis of changes in body mass index across the adult life course: a study with 65 years of follow-up.",
    "abstract": "Although the negative consequences on health of being obese are well known, most adults gain weight across the lifespan. The general increase in body mass index (BMI) is mainly considered to originate from behavioral and environmental changes; however, few studies have evaluated the influence of these factors on change in BMI in the presence of genetic risk. We aimed to study the influence of multifactorial causes of change in BMI, over 65 years.\n\nTotally, 6130 participants from TwinGene, who had up to five assessments, and 536 from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, who had up to 12 assessments, ranging over 65 years were included. The influence of lifestyle factors, birth cohort, cardiometabolic diseases and an individual obesity genetic risk score (OGRS) based on 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms on change in BMI was evaluated with a growth model. For both sexes, BMI increased from early adulthood to age of 65 years, after which the increase leveled off; BMI declined after age of 80 years. A higher OGRS, birth after 1925 and cardiometabolic diseases were associated with higher average BMI and a steeper increase in BMI prior to 65 years of age. Among men, few factors were identified that influence BMI trajectories in late life, whereas for women type 2 diabetes mellitus and dementia were associated with a steeper decrease in BMI after the age of 65 years.\n\nThere are two turning points in BMI in late adulthood, one at the age of 65 years and one at the age 80 years. Factors associated with an increase in BMI in midlife were not associated with an increase in BMI after the age of 65 years. These findings indicate that the causes and consequences of change in BMI differ across the lifespan. Current health recommendations need to be adjusted accordingly.",

    "title": "Genomic sequencing of a dyslexia susceptibility haplotype encompassing ROBO1.",
    "abstract": "The DYX5 locus for developmental dyslexia was mapped to chromosome 3 by linkage study of a large Finnish family, and later, roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) was implicated as a candidate gene at DYX5 with suppressed expression from the segregating rare haplotype. A functional magnetoencephalographic study of several family members revealed abnormal auditory processing of interaural interaction, supporting a defect in midline crossing of auditory pathways. In the current study, we have characterized genetic variation in the broad ROBO1 gene region in the DYX5-linked family, aiming to identify variants that would increase our understanding of the altered expression of ROBO1.\n\nWe have used a whole genome sequencing strategy on a pooled sample of 19 individuals in combination with two individually sequenced genomes. The discovered genetic variants were annotated and filtered. Subsequently, the most interesting variants were functionally tested using relevant methods, including electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), luciferase assay, and gene knockdown by lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in lymphoblasts.\n\nWe found one novel intronic single nucleotide variant (SNV) and three novel intergenic SNVs in the broad region of ROBO1 that were specific to the dyslexia susceptibility haplotype. Functional testing by EMSA did not support the binding of transcription factors to three of the SNVs, but one of the SNVs was bound by the LIM homeobox 2 (LHX2) protein, with increased binding affinity for the non-reference allele. Knockdown of LHX2 in lymphoblast cell lines extracted from subjects from the DYX5-linked family showed decreasing expression of ROBO1, supporting the idea that LHX2 regulates ROBO1 also in human.\n\nThe discovered variants may explain the segregation of dyslexia in this family, but the effect appears subtle in the experimental settings. Their impact on the developing human brain remains suggestive based on the association and subtle experimental support.",

    "title": "Bioarchaeological evidence of one of the earliest Islamic burials in the Levant.",
    "abstract": "The Middle East plays a central role in human history harbouring a vast diversity of ethnic, cultural and religious groups. However, much remains to be understood about past and present genomic diversity in this region. Here we present a multidisciplinary bioarchaeological analysis of two individuals dated to the late 7th and early 8th centuries, the Umayyad Era, from Tell Qarassa, an open-air site in modern-day Syria. Radiocarbon dates and burial type are consistent with one of the earliest Islamic Arab burials in the Levant. Interestingly, we found genomic similarity to a genotyped group of modern-day Bedouins and Saudi rather than to most neighbouring Levantine groups. This study represents the genomic analysis of a secondary use site with characteristics consistent with an early Islamic burial in the Levant. We discuss our findings and possible historic scenarios in the light of forces such as genetic drift and their possible interaction with religious and cultural processes (including diet and subsistence practices).",

    "title": "Plastid phylogenomics and cytonuclear discordance in Rubioideae, Rubiaceae.",
    "abstract": "In this study of evolutionary relationships in the subfamily Rubioideae (Rubiaceae), we take advantage of the off-target proportion of reads generated via previous target capture sequencing projects based on nuclear genomic data to build a plastome phylogeny and investigate cytonuclear discordance. The assembly of off-target reads resulted in a comprehensive plastome dataset and robust inference of phylogenetic relationships, where most intratribal and intertribal relationships are resolved with strong support. While the phylogenetic results were mostly in agreement with previous studies based on plastome data, novel relationships in the plastid perspective were also detected. For example, our analyses of plastome data provide strong support for the SCOUT clade and its sister relationship to the remaining members of the subfamily, which differs from previous results based on plastid data but agrees with recent results based on nuclear genomic data. However, several instances of highly supported cytonuclear discordance were identified across the Rubioideae phylogeny. Coalescent simulation analysis indicates that while ILS could, by itself, explain the majority of the discordant relationships, plastome introgression may be the better explanation in some cases. Our study further indicates that plastomes across the Rubioideae are, with few exceptions, highly conserved and mainly conform to the structure, gene content, and gene order present in the majority of the flowering plants.",

    "title": "A genetic-epigenetic interplay at 1q21.1 locus underlies CHD1L-mediated vulnerability to primary progressive multiple sclerosis.",
    "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease with an unpredictable course towards progressive disability. Treating progressive MS is challenging due to limited insights into the underlying mechanisms. We examined the molecular changes associated with primary progressive MS (PPMS) using a cross-tissue (blood and post-mortem brain) and multilayered data (genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic) from independent cohorts. In PPMS, we found hypermethylation of the 1q21.1 locus, controlled by PPMS-specific genetic variations and influencing the expression of proximal genes (CHD1L, PRKAB2) in the brain. Evidence from reporter assay and CRISPR/dCas9 experiments supports a causal link between methylation and expression and correlation network analysis further implicates these genes in PPMS brain processes. Knock-down of CHD1L in human iPSC-derived neurons and knock-out of chd1l in zebrafish led to developmental and functional deficits of neurons. Thus, several lines of evidence suggest a distinct genetic-epigenetic-transcriptional interplay in the 1q21.1 locus potentially contributing to PPMS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Network inference is an important aim of systems biology. It enables the transformation of OMICs datasets into biological knowledge. It consists of reverse engineering gene regulatory networks from OMICs data, such as RNAseq or mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, through computational methods. This approach allows to identify signalling pathways involved in specific biological functions. The ability to infer causality in gene regulatory networks, in addition to correlation, is crucial for several modelling approaches and allows targeted control in biotechnology applications.\n\nWe performed simulations according to the approximate Bayesian computation method, where the core model consisted of a steady-state simulation algorithm used to study gene regulatory networks in systems for which a limited level of details is available. The simulations outcome was compared to experimentally measured transcriptomics and proteomics data through approximate Bayesian computation.\n\nThe structure of small gene regulatory networks responsible for the regulation of biological functions involved in biomining were inferred from multi OMICs data of mixed bacterial cultures. Several causal inter- and intraspecies interactions were inferred between genes coding for proteins involved in the biomining process, such as heavy metal transport, DNA damage, replication and repair, and membrane biogenesis. The method also provided indications for the role of several uncharacterized proteins by the inferred connection in their network context.\n\nThe combination of fast algorithms with high-performance computing allowed the simulation of a multitude of gene regulatory networks and their comparison to experimentally measured OMICs data through approximate Bayesian computation, enabling the probabilistic inference of causality in gene regulatory networks of a multispecies bacterial system involved in biomining without need of single-cell or multiple perturbation experiments. This information can be used to influence biological functions and control specific processes in biotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "Acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a common finding in myeloid malignancies and typically acts to convert a somatically acquired heterozygous mutation to homozygosity. We sought to identify the target of chromosome 14 aUPD (aUPD14), a recurrent abnormality in myeloid neoplasms and population cohorts of elderly individuals. We identified 29 cases with aUPD14q that defined a minimal affected region (MAR) of 11.2 Mb running from 14q32.12 to the telomere. Exome sequencing (n=7) did not identify recurrently mutated genes, but methylation-specific PCR at the imprinted MEG3-DLK1 locus located within the MAR demonstrated loss of maternal chromosome 14 and gain of paternal chromosome 14 (P<0.0001), with the degree of methylation imbalance correlating with the level of aUPD (r=0.76; P=0.0001). The absence of driver gene mutations in the exomes of three individuals with aUPD14q but no known haematological disorder suggests that aUPD14q may be sufficient to drive clonal haemopoiesis. Analysis of cases with both aUPD14q and JAK2 V617F (n=11) indicated that aUPD14q may be an early event in some cases but a late event in others. We conclude that aUPD14q is a recurrent abnormality that targets an imprinted locus and may promote clonal haemopoiesis either as an initiating event or as a secondary change.",

    "abstract": "Does the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) of Klinefelter syndrome (KS)-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) correspond to female human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and reflect the KS genotype?\n\nOur results demonstrate for the first time that KS-derived hiPSCs show similar XCI behavior to female hPSCs in culture and show biological relevance to KS genotype-related clinical features.\n\nSo far, assessment of XCI of KS-derived hiPSCs was based on H3K27me3 staining and X-inactive specific transcript gene expression disregarding the at least three XCI states (XaXi with XIST coating, XaXi lacking XIST coating, and XaXe (partially eroded XCI)) that female hPSCs display in culture.\n\nThe study used hiPSC lines generated from two azoospermic patients with KS and included two healthy male (HM) and one healthy female donor.\n\nIn this study, we derived hiPSCs by reprograming fibroblasts with episomal plasmids and applying laminin 521 as culture substrate. hiPSCs were characterized by karyotyping, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, teratoma formation, and embryoid body differentiation. XCI and KS hiPSC relevance were assessed by whole genome transcriptomics analysis and immunocytochemistry plus FISH of KS, HM and female fibroblast, and their hiPSC derivatives.\n\nApplying whole genome transcriptomics analysis, we could identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between KS and HM donors with enrichment in gene ontology terms associated with fertility, cardiovascular development, ossification, and brain development, all associated with KS genotype-related clinical features. Furthermore, XCI analysis based on transcriptomics data, RNA FISH, and H3K27me3 staining revealed variable XCI states of KS hiPSCs similar to female hiPSCs, showing either normal (XaXi) or eroded (XaXe) XCI. KS hiPSCs with normal XCI showed nevertheless upregulated X-linked genes involved in nervous system development as well as synaptic transmission, supporting the potential use of KS-derived hiPSCs as an in vitro model for KS.\n\nDetailed clinical information for patients included in this study was not available. Although a correlation between DEGs and the KS genotype could be observed, the biological relevance of these cells has to be confirmed with further experiments. In addition, karyotype analysis for two hiPSC lines was performed at passage 12 but not repeated at a later passage. Nevertheless, since all XCI experiments for those lines were performed between passage 11 and 15 the authors expect no karyotypic changes for those experiments.\n\nAs KS patients have variable clinical phenotypes that are influenced by the grade of aneuploidy, mosaicism, origin of the X chromosome, and XCI 'escapee' genes, which vary not only among individuals but also among different tissues within the same individual, differentiated KS hiPSCs could be used for a better understanding of KS pathogenesis.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (2016.0121 and 2015.0096), Ming Wai Lau Centre for Reparative Medicine (2-343/2016), Ragnar Söderberg Foundation (M67/13), Swedish Research Council (2013-32485-100360-69), the Centre for Innovative Medicine (2-388/2016-40), Kronprinsessan Lovisas Förening För Barnasjukvård/Stiftelsen Axel Tielmans Minnesfond, Samariten Foundation, Jonasson Center at the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and Initial Training Network Marie Curie Program 'Growsperm' (EU-FP7-PEOPLE-2013-ITN 603568).

    "title": "Genetic influence of a STAU2 frameshift mutation and RELN regulatory elements on performance in Icelandic horses.",
    "abstract": "Selection for performance in horse breeding benefits from precise genetic insights at a molecular level, but knowledge remains limited. This study used whole-genome sequences of 39 elite and non-elite Icelandic horses to identify candidate causal variants linked to previously identified haplotypes in the STAU2 and RELN genes affecting pace and other gaits. A frameshift variant in linkage disequilibrium with the previously identified haplotypes in the STAU2 gene (r2 = 0.85) was identified within a predicted STAU2 transcript. This variant alters the amino acid sequence and introduces a premature stop codon but does not appear harmful or disease-causing and is potentially unique to equine biology. A large portion of the RELN haplotype overlapped with an H3K27me3 modification mark, suggesting a regulatory role of this region. Despite the small sample size, the RELN haplotype's effects were validated for tölt, trot, and canter/gallop. Additionally, the RELN haplotype significantly influenced the age at which horses were presented for breeding field tests, indicating a potential role of the region in precocity and trainability. Functional experiments are needed to further investigate the regions' influences on biological processes and their potential impact on horse performance.",

    "abstract": "The impact of microbial composition on stress-related behavior in aquatic organisms is poorly understood. This study explored the link between antipredator behavior, parasitism, and the gut microbiome in wild stickleback from two lakes: clear, spring-fed Galtaból and turbid, glacial-fed Þristikla. Behavioral analysis revealed differences between populations, with each exhibiting unique baseline behaviors. Microbiome analysis showed that a small proportion of its variation was explained by population, likely reflecting differences in lake environments. Only the marine genus Pseudoalteromonas abundance differed between populations. Our findings suggest that behavior and microbiome correlations may primarily reflect environmental adaptations and parasite status rather than direct gut-brain interactions. However, some tentative evidence suggests a potential innate connection between some antipredator behavior and microbiome composition. The study highlights the complexity of the gut-brain axis in wild populations and suggests future research directions, including experimental manipulations to uncover causal relationships between microbiome composition and behavior.",

    "title": "Targeted copy number screening highlights an intragenic deletion of WDR63 as the likely cause of human occipital encephalocele and abnormal CNS development in zebrafish.",
    "abstract": "Congenital malformations affecting the neural tube can present as isolated malformations or occur in association with other developmental abnormalities and syndromes. Using high resolution copy number screening in 66 fetuses with neural tube defects we identified 6 fetuses with likely pathogenic mutations, three aneuploidies (one trisomy 13 and two trisomy 18) and three deletions previously reported in NTDs (one 22q11.2 deletion and two 1p36 deletions) corresponding to 9% of the cohort. In addition, we identified five rare deletions and two duplications of uncertain significance including a rare intragenic heterozygous in-frame WDR63 deletion in a fetus with occipital encephalocele. Whole genome sequencing verified the deletion and excluded known pathogenic variants. The deletion spans exons 14-17 resulting in the expression of a protein missing the third and fourth WD-repeat domains. These findings were supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated somatic deletions in zebrafish. Injection of two different sgRNA-pairs targeting relevant intronic regions resulted in a deletion mimicking the human deletion and a concomitant increase of abnormal embryos with body and brain malformations (41%, n = 161 and 62%, n = 224 respectively), including a sac-like brain protrusion (7% and 9%, p < 0.01). Similar results were seen with overexpression of RNA encoding the deleted variant in zebrafish (Total abnormal;46%, n = 255, P < 0.001) compared to overexpression of an equivalent amount of wild-type RNA (Total abnormal;3%, n = 177). We predict the in-frame WDR63 deletion to result in a dominant negative or gain of function form of WDR63. These are the first findings supporting a role for WDR63 in encephalocele formation.
