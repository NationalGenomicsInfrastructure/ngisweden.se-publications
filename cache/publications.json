    "title": "In-depth transcriptome analysis reveals novel TARs and prevalent antisense transcription in human cell lines.",
    "abstract": "Several recent studies have indicated that transcription is pervasive in regions outside of protein coding genes and that short antisense transcripts can originate from the promoter and terminator regions of genes. Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12% to 16% of all reads that originate from promoter and terminator regions, respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, terminator and intron regions of protein-coding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias.",

    "title": "Painting of Fourth and the X-Linked 1.688 Satellite in D. melanogaster is Involved in Chromosome-Wide Gene Regulation.",
    "abstract": "Chromosome-specific regulatory mechanisms provide a model to understand the coordinated regulation of genes on entire chromosomes or on larger genomic regions. In fruit flies, two chromosome-wide systems have been characterized: The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which mediates dosage compensation and primarily acts on the male X-chromosome, and Painting of fourth (POF), which governs chromosome-specific regulation of genes located on the 4th chromosome. How targeting of one specific chromosome evolves is still not understood; but repeated sequences, in forms of satellites and transposable elements, are thought to facilitate the evolution of chromosome-specific targeting. The highly repetitive 1.688 satellite has been functionally connected to both these systems. Considering the rapid evolution and the necessarily constant adaptation of regulatory mechanisms, such as dosage compensation, we hypothesised that POF and/or 1.688 may still show traces of dosage-compensation functions. Here, we test this hypothesis by transcriptome analysis. We show that loss of Pof decreases not only chromosome 4 expression but also reduces the X-chromosome expression in males. The 1.688 repeat deletion, Zhr1 (Zygotic hybrid rescue), does not affect male dosage compensation detectably; however, Zhr1 in females causes a stimulatory effect on X-linked genes with a strong binding affinity to the MSL complex (genes close to high-affinity sites). Lack of pericentromeric 1.688 also affected 1.688 expression in trans and was linked to the differential expression of genes involved in eggshell formation. We discuss our results with reference to the connections between POF, the 1.688 satellite and dosage compensation, and the role of the 1.688 satellite in hybrid lethality.",

    "abstract": "The Plasmodium falciparum life cycle includes obligate transition between a human and mosquito host. Gametocytes are responsible for transmission from the human to the mosquito vector where gamete fusion followed by meiosis occurs. To elucidate how male and female gametocytes differentiate in the absence of sex chromosomes, we perform FACS-based cell enrichment of a P. falciparum gametocyte reporter line followed by single-cell RNA-seq. In our analyses we define the transcriptional programs and predict candidate driver genes underlying male and female development, including genes from the ApiAP2 family of transcription factors. A motif-driven, gene regulatory network analysis indicates that AP2-G5 specifically modulates male development. Additionally, genes linked to the inner membrane complex, involved in morphological changes, are uniquely expressed in the female lineage. The transcriptional programs of male and female development detailed herein allow for further exploration of the evolution of sex in eukaryotes and provide targets for future development of transmission blocking therapies.",

    "title": "Compositional and functional differences of the mucosal microbiota along the intestine of healthy individuals.",
    "abstract": "Gut mucosal microbes evolved closest to the host, developing specialized local communities. There is, however, insufficient knowledge of these communities as most studies have employed sequencing technologies to investigate faecal microbiota only. This work used shotgun metagenomics of mucosal biopsies to explore the microbial communities' compositions of terminal ileum and large intestine in 5 healthy individuals. Functional annotations and genome-scale metabolic modelling of selected species were then employed to identify local functional enrichments. While faecal metagenomics provided a good approximation of the average gut mucosal microbiome composition, mucosal biopsies allowed detecting the subtle variations of local microbial communities. Given their significant enrichment in the mucosal microbiota, we highlight the roles of Bacteroides species and describe the antimicrobial resistance biogeography along the intestine. We also detail which species, at which locations, are involved with the tryptophan/indole pathway, whose malfunctioning has been linked to pathologies including inflammatory bowel disease. Our study thus provides invaluable resources for investigating mechanisms connecting gut microbiota and host pathophysiology.",

    "title": "Transcriptional responses in developing lesions of European common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) reveal genes responding to infection by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus.",
    "abstract": "With the expanding ash dieback epidemic that has spread across the European continent, an improved functional understanding of the disease development in afflicted hosts is needed. The study investigated whether differences in necrosis extension between common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees with different levels of susceptibility to the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus are associated with, and can be explained by, the differences in gene expression patterns. We inoculated seemingly healthy branches of each of two resistant and susceptible ash genotypes with H. fraxineus grown in a common garden.\n\nTen months after the inoculation, the length of necrosis on the resistant genotypes were shorter than on the susceptible genotypes. RNA sequencing of bark samples collected at the border of necrotic lesions and from healthy tissues distal to the lesion revealed relatively limited differences in gene expression patterns between susceptible and resistant genotypes. At the necrosis front, only 138 transcripts were differentially expressed between the genotype categories while 1082 were differentially expressed in distal, non-symptomatic tissues. Among these differentially expressed genes, several genes in the mevalonate (MVA) and iridoid pathways were found to be co-regulated, possibly indicating increased fluxes through these pathways in response to H. fraxineus. Comparison of transcriptional responses of symptomatic and non-symptomatic ash in a controlled greenhouse experiment revealed a relatively small set of genes that were differentially and concordantly expressed in both studies. This gene-set included the rate-limiting enzyme in the MVA pathway and a number of transcription factors. Furthermore, several of the concordantly expressed candidate genes show significant similarity to genes encoding players in the abscisic acid- or Jasmonate-signalling pathways.\n\nA set of candidate genes, concordantly expressed between field and greenhouse experiments, was identified. The candidates are associated with hormone signalling and specialized metabolite biosynthesis pathways indicating the involvement of these pathways in the response of the host to infection by H. fraxineus.",

    "title": "Evidence of Site-Specific and Male-Biased Germline Mutation Rate in a Wild Songbird.",
    "abstract": "Germline mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and the raw material for organismal evolution. Despite their significance, the frequency and genomic locations of mutations, as well as potential sex bias, are yet to be widely investigated in most species. To address these gaps, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of 12 great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) in a pedigree spanning 3 generations to identify single-nucleotide de novo mutations (DNMs) and estimate the germline mutation rate. We detected 82 DNMs within the pedigree, primarily enriched at CpG sites but otherwise randomly located along the chromosomes. Furthermore, we observed a pronounced sex bias in DNM occurrence, with male warblers exhibiting three times more mutations than females. After correction for false negatives and adjusting for callable sites, we obtained a mutation rate of 7.16 √ó 10-9 mutations per site per generation (m/s/g) for the autosomes and 5.10 √ó 10-9 m/s/g for the Z chromosome. To demonstrate the utility of species-specific mutation rates, we applied our autosomal mutation rate in models reconstructing the demographic history of the great reed warbler. We uncovered signs of drastic population size reductions predating the last glacial period (LGP) and reduced gene flow between western and eastern populations during the LGP. In conclusion, our results provide one of the few direct estimates of the mutation rate in wild songbirds and evidence for male-driven mutations in accordance with theoretical expectations.",

    "abstract": "ZC3H11A (zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 11A) is a stress-induced mRNA-binding protein required for efficient growth of nuclear-replicating viruses. The cellular functions of ZC3H11A during embryonic development are unknown. Here, we report the generation and phenotypic characterization of Zc3h11a knockout (KO) mice. Heterozygous null Zc3h11a mice were born at the expected frequency without distinguishable phenotypic differences compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, homozygous null Zc3h11a mice were missing, indicating that Zc3h11a is crucial for embryonic viability and survival. Zc3h11a -/- embryos were detected at the expected Mendelian ratios up to late preimplantation stage (E4.5). However, phenotypic characterization at E6.5 revealed degeneration of Zc3h11a -/- embryos, indicating developmental defects around the time of implantation. Transcriptomic analyses documented a dysregulation of glycolysis and fatty acid metabolic pathways in Zc3h11a-/- embryos at E4.5. Proteomic analysis indicated a tight interaction between ZC3H11A and mRNA-export proteins in embryonic stem cells. CLIP-seq analysis demonstrated that ZC3H11A binds a subset of mRNA transcripts that are critical for metabolic regulation of embryonic cells. Furthermore, embryonic stem cells with an induced deletion of Zc3h11a display an impaired differentiation toward epiblast-like cells and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential. Altogether, the results show that ZC3H11A is participating in export and posttranscriptional regulation of selected mRNA transcripts required to maintain metabolic processes in embryonic cells. While ZC3H11A is essential for the viability of the early mouse embryo, inactivation of Zc3h11a expression in adult tissues using a conditional KO did not lead to obvious phenotypic defects.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive convergent evolution and in part high incidences of hybridization distinguish wheatears (songbirds of the genus Oenanthe) as a versatile system to address questions at the forefront of research on the molecular bases of phenotypic and species diversification. To prepare the genomic resources for this venture, we here generated and annotated a chromosome-scale assembly of the Eastern black-eared wheatear (Oenanthe melanoleuca). This species is part of the Oenanthe hispanica complex that is characterized by convergent evolution of plumage coloration and high rates of hybridization. The long-read-based male nuclear genome assembly comprises 1.04 Gb in 32 autosomes, the Z chromosome, and the mitogenome. The assembly is highly contiguous (contig N50, 12.6 Mb; scaffold N50, 70 Mb), with 96% of the genome assembled at the chromosome level and 95.5% benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) completeness. The nuclear genome was annotated with 18,143 protein-coding genes and 31,333 mRNAs (annotation BUSCO completeness, 98.0%), and about 10% of the genome consists of repetitive DNA. The annotated chromosome-scale reference genome of Eastern black-eared wheatear provides a crucial resource for research into the genomics of adaptation and speciation in an intriguing group of passerines.",

    "title": "Enhancer mutations modulate the severity of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.",
    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and many patients are still treated with classical chemotherapy. The unselective nature of chemotherapy often results in severe myelosuppression. Previous studies showed that protein-coding mutations could not fully explain the predisposition to myelosuppression. Here, we investigate the possible role of enhancer mutations in myelosuppression susceptibility. We produced transcriptome and promoter-interaction maps (using HiCap) of three blood stem-like cell lines treated with carboplatin or gemcitabine. Taking advantage of publicly available enhancer datasets, we validated HiCap results in silico and in living cells using epigenetic CRISPR technology. We also developed a network approach for interactome analysis and detection of differentially interacting genes. Differential interaction analysis provided additional information on relevant genes and pathways for myelosuppression compared with differential gene expression analysis at the bulk level. Moreover, we showed that enhancers of differentially interacting genes are highly enriched for variants associated with differing levels of myelosuppression. Altogether, our work represents a prominent example of integrative transcriptome and gene regulatory datasets analysis for the functional annotation of noncoding mutations.",

    "title": "Genetics of tibia bone properties of crossbred commercial laying hens in different housing systems.",
    "abstract": "Osteoporosis and bone fractures are a severe problem for the welfare of laying hens, with genetics and environment, such as housing system, each making substantial contributions to bone strength. In this work, we performed genetic analyses of bone strength, bone mineral density and bone composition, as well as body weight, in 860 commercial crossbred laying hens from two different companies, kept in either furnished cages or floor pens. We compared bone traits between housing systems and crossbreds, and performed a genome-wide association study of bone properties and body weight. As expected, the two housing systems produced a large difference in bone strength, with layers housed in floor pens having stronger bones. These differences were accompanied by differences in bone geometry, mineralisation and chemical composition. Genome-scans either combining or independently analysing the two housing systems revealed no genome-wide significant loci for bone breaking strength. We detected three loci for body weight that were shared between the housing systems on chromosomes 4, 6 and 27 (either genome-wide significant or suggestive) and these coincide with associations for bone length. In summary, we found substantial differences in bone strength, content and composition between hens kept in floor pens and furnished cages that could be attributed to greater physical activity in pen housing. We found little evidence for large-effect loci for bone strength in commercial crossbred hens, consistent with a highly polygenic architecture for bone strength in the production environment.‚Äã The lack of consistent genetic associations between housing systems in combination with the differences in bone phenotypes could be due to gene-by-environment interactions with housing system or a lack of power to detect shared associations for bone strength.",

    "abstract": "Due to its central importance to many aspects of evolutionary biology and population genetics, the long-term effective population size (Ne ) has been estimated for numerous species and populations. However, estimating contemporary Ne is difficult and in practice this parameter is often unknown. In principle, contemporary Ne can be estimated using either analyses of temporal changes in allele frequencies, or the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between unlinked markers. We applied these approaches to estimate contemporary Ne of a relatively recently founded island population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We sequenced the genomes of 85 birds sampled in 1993 and 2015, and applied several temporal methods to estimate Ne at a few thousand (4000-7000). The approach based on LD provided higher estimates of Ne (20,000-32,000) and was associated with high variance, often resulting in infinite Ne . We conclude that whole-genome sequencing data offers new possibilities to estimate high (>1000) contemporary Ne , but also note that such estimates remain challenging, in particular for LD-based methods for contemporary Ne estimation.",

    "title": "Transcriptional mutagenesis dramatically alters genome-wide p53 transactivation landscape.",
    "abstract": "The transcriptional error rate can be significantly increased by the presence of DNA lesions that instruct mis-insertion during transcription; a process referred to as transcriptional mutagenesis (TM) that can result in altered protein function. Herein, we determined the effect of O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) on transcription and subsequent transactivation activity of p53 in human lung H1299 cells. Levels of TM and effects on transactivation were determined genome wide by RNA-seq. Results showed that 47% of all p53 transcripts contained an uridine misincorporation opposite the lesion at 6 h post transfection, which was decreased to 18% at 24 h. TM at these levels reduced DNA binding activity of p53 to 21% and 80% compared to wild type p53, respectively. Gene expression data were analysed to identify differentially expressed genes due to TM of p53. We show a temporal repression of transactivation of > 100 high confidence p53 target genes including regulators of the cell cycle, DNA damage response and apoptosis. In addition, TM repressed the transcriptional downregulation by p53 of several negative regulators of proliferation and differentiation. Our work demonstrates that TM, even when restricting its effect to an individual transcription factor, has the potential to alter gene expression programs and diversify cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Species from the genus Phytophthora are well represented among organisms causing serious diseases on trees. Phytophthora plurivora has been implicated in long-term decline of woodland trees across Europe. Here we present a draft genome sequence of P. plurivora, originally isolated from diseased European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Malm√∂, Sweden. When compared with other sequenced Phytophthora species, the P. plurivora genome assembly is relatively compact, spanning 41‚ÄâMb. This is organized in 1,919 contigs and 1,898 scaffolds, encompassing 11,741 predicted genes, and has a repeat content of approximately 15%. Comparison of allele frequencies revealed evidence for tetraploidy in the sequenced isolate. As in other sequenced Phytophthora species, P. plurivora possesses genes for pathogenicity-associated RXLR and Crinkle and Necrosis effectors, predominantly located in gene-sparse genomic regions. Comparison of the P. plurivora RXLR effectors with orthologs in other sequenced species in the same clade (Phytophthora multivora and Phytophthora capsici) revealed that the orthologs were likely to be under neutral or purifying selection.",

    "title": "Canonical WNT signaling-dependent gating of MYC requires a noncanonical CTCF function at a distal binding site.",
    "abstract": "Abnormal WNT signaling increases MYC expression in colon cancer cells in part via oncogenic super-enhancer-(OSE)-mediated gating of the active MYC to the nuclear pore in a poorly understood process. We show here that the principal tenet of the WNT-regulated MYC gating, facilitating nuclear export of the MYC mRNA, is regulated by a CTCF binding site (CTCFBS) within the OSE to confer growth advantage in HCT-116 cells. To achieve this, the CTCFBS directs the WNT-dependent trafficking of the OSE to the nuclear pore from intra-nucleoplasmic positions in a stepwise manner. Once the OSE reaches a peripheral position, which is triggered by a CTCFBS-mediated CCAT1 eRNA activation, its final stretch (‚â§0.7 Œºm) to the nuclear pore requires the recruitment of AHCTF1, a key nucleoporin, to the CTCFBS. Thus, a WNT/√ü-catenin-AHCTF1-CTCF-eRNA circuit enables the OSE to promote pathological cell growth by coordinating the trafficking of the active MYC gene within the 3D nuclear architecture.",

    "title": "Phenotypic and transcriptomic acclimation of the green microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata to high environmental levels of the herbicide diflufenican.",
    "abstract": "Herbicide pollution poses a worldwide threat to plants and freshwater ecosystems. However, the understanding of how organisms develop tolerance to these chemicals and the associated trade-off expenses are largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the physiological and transcriptional mechanisms underlying the acclimation of the green microalgal model species Raphidocelis subcapitata (Selenastraceae) towards the herbicide diflufenican, and the fitness costs associated with tolerance development. Algae were exposed for 12 weeks (corresponding to 100 generations) to diflufenican at the two environmental concentrations 10 and 310 ng/L. The monitoring of growth, pigment composition, and photosynthetic performance throughout the experiment revealed an initial dose-dependent stress phase (week 1) with an EC50 of 397 ng/L, followed by a time-dependent recovery phase during weeks 2 to 4. After week 4, R. subcapitata was acclimated to diflufenican exposure with a similar growth rate, content of carotenoids, and photosynthetic performance as the unexposed control algae. This acclimation state of the algae was explored in terms of tolerance acquisition, changes in the fatty acids composition, diflufenican removal rate, cell size, and changes in mRNA gene expression profile, revealing potential fitness costs associated with acclimation, such as up-regulation of genes related to cell division, structure, morphology, and reduction of cell size. Overall, this study demonstrates that R. subcapitata can quickly acclimate to environmental but toxic levels of diflufenican; however, the acclimation is associated with trade-off expenses that result in smaller cell size.",

    "abstract": "Defining the transition from benign to malignant tissue is fundamental to improving early diagnosis of cancer1. Here we use a systematic approach to study spatial genome integrity in situ and describe previously unidentified clonal relationships. We used spatially resolved transcriptomics2 to infer spatial copy number variations in >120,000 regions across multiple organs, in benign and malignant tissues. We demonstrate that genome-wide copy number variation reveals distinct clonal patterns within tumours and in nearby benign tissue using an organ-wide approach focused on the prostate. Our results suggest a model for how genomic instability arises in histologically benign tissue that may represent early events in cancer evolution. We highlight the power of capturing the molecular and spatial continuums in a tissue context and challenge the rationale for treatment paradigms, including focal therapy.",

    "abstract": "The Baltic Sea is one of the world's largest brackish water bodies and is characterised by pronounced physicochemical gradients where microbes are the main biogeochemical catalysts. Meta-omic methods provide rich information on the composition of, and activities within, microbial ecosystems, but are computationally heavy to perform. We here present the Baltic Sea Reference Metagenome (BARM), complete with annotated genes to facilitate further studies with much less computational effort. The assembly is constructed using 2.6 billion metagenomic reads from 81 water samples, spanning both spatial and temporal dimensions, and contains 6.8 million genes that have been annotated for function and taxonomy. The assembly is useful as a reference, facilitating taxonomic and functional annotation of additional samples by simply mapping their reads against the assembly. This capability is demonstrated by the successful mapping and annotation of 24 external samples. In addition, we present a public web interface, BalticMicrobeDB, for interactive exploratory analysis of the dataset.",

    "title": "O6-methylguanine‚Äìinduced transcriptional mutagenesis reduces p53 tumor-suppressor function",
    "abstract": "Altered protein function due to mutagenesis plays an important role in disease development. This is perhaps most evident in tumorigenesis and the associated loss or gain of function of tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes. The extent to which lesion-induced transcriptional mutagenesis (TM) influences protein function and its contribution to the development of disease is not well understood. In this study, the impact of O6-methylguanine on the transcription fidelity of p53 and the subsequent effects on the protein‚Äôs function as a regulator of cell death and cell-cycle arrest were examined in human cells. Levels of TM were determined by RNA-sequencing. In cells with active DNA repair, misincorporation of uridine opposite the lesion occurred in 0.14% of the transcripts and increased to 14.7% when repair by alkylguanine‚ÄìDNA alkyltransferase was compromised. Expression of the dominant-negative p53 R248W mutant due to TM significantly reduced the transactivation of several established p53 target genes that mediate the tumor-suppressor function, including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This resulted in deregulated signaling through the retinoblastoma protein and loss of G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint function. In addition, we observed impaired activation of apoptosis coupled to the reduction of the tumor-suppressor functions of p53. Taking these findings together, this work provides evidence that TM can induce phenotypic changes in mammalian cells that have important implications for the role of TM in tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Karonudib (TH1579) is a novel compound that exerts anti-tumor activities and has recently entered phase I clinical testing. The aim of this study was to conduct a pre-clinical trial in patient-derived xenografts to identify the possible biomarkers of response or resistance that could guide inclusion of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma in phase II clinical trials. Patient-derived xenografts from 31 melanoma patients with metastatic disease were treated with karonudib or a vehicle for 18 days. Treatment responses were followed by measuring tumor sizes, and the models were categorized in the response groups. Tumors were harvested and processed for RNA sequencing and protein analysis. To investigate the effect of karonudib on T-cell-mediated anti-tumor activities, tumor-infiltrating T cells were injected in mice carrying autologous tumors and the mice treated with karonudib. We show that karonudib has heterogeneous anti-tumor effect on metastatic melanoma. Thus, based on the treatment responses, we could divide the 31 patient-derived xenografts in three treatment groups: progression group (32%), suppression group (42%), and regression group (26%). Furthermore, we show that karonudib has anti-tumor effect, irrespective of major melanoma driver mutations. Also, we identify high expression of ABCB1, which codes for p-gp pumps as a resistance biomarker. Finally, we show that karonudib treatment does not hamper T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. These findings can be used to guide future use of karonudib in clinical use with a potential approach as precision medicine.",

Balto shares just part of his diverse ancestry with the eponymous Siberian husky breed. Balto's genotype predicts a combination of coat features atypical for modern sled dog breeds, and a slightly smaller stature. He had enhanced starch digestion compared with Greenland sled dogs and a compendium of derived homozygous coding variants at constrained positions in genes connected to bone and skin development. We propose that Balto's population of origin, which was less inbred and genetically healthier than that of modern breeds, was adapted to the extreme environment of 1920s Alaska.",

    "title": "Exploring the Œ≤-tubulin gene family in a benzimidazole-resistant Parascaris univalens population.",
    "abstract": "Benzimidazole (BZ) drugs are frequently used to treat infections with the equine ascarid Parascaris univalens due to increasing resistance to macrocyclic lactones and pyrantel. Benzimidazole resistance is rare in ascarids in contrast to strongyle parasites where this resistance is widespread. In strongyles, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at codons 167, 198 and 200 in a Œ≤-tubulin gene have been correlated to BZ resistance, but little is known about the Œ≤-tubulin genes and their possible involvement in BZ resistance in P. univalens and other ascarids. Previously two Œ≤-tubulin genes have been identified in P. univalens. In this study, we present five additional Œ≤-tubulin genes as well as the phylogenetic relationship of all seven genes to Œ≤-tubulins of other clade III and V nematodes. In addition, the efficacy of fenbendazole for treatment of P. univalens on a Swedish stud farm was studied in 2019 and 2020 using faecal egg count reduction test. Reductions varied from 73% to 88%, indicating the presence of a resistant P. univalens population on the farm. The emergence of BZ resistance emphasizes the need for development of molecular markers for rapid and more sensitive detection of resistant populations. We therefore investigated whether possible SNPs at positions 167, 198 or 200 in any of the Œ≤-tubulin genes could be used to distinguish between resistant and susceptible P. univalens populations. Amplicon sequencing covering the mutation sites 167, 198 and 200 in all seven Œ≤-tubulin genes revealed an absence of SNPs in both resistant and susceptible populations, suggesting that the mechanism behind BZ resistance in ascarids is different from that in strongyle nematodes and the search for a molecular marker for BZ resistance in P. univalens needs to continue.",

    "title": "Evidence for widespread selection in shaping the genomic landscape during speciation of Populus.",
    "abstract": "Increasing our understanding of how evolutionary processes drive the genomic landscape of variation is fundamental to a better understanding of the genomic consequences of speciation. However, genome-wide patterns of within- and between- species variation have not been fully investigated in most forest tree species despite their global ecological and economic importance. Here, we use whole-genome resequencing data from four Populus species spanning the speciation continuum to reconstruct their demographic histories and investigate patterns of diversity and divergence within and between species. Using Populus trichocarpa as an outgroup species, we further infer the genealogical relationships and estimate the extent of ancient introgression among the three aspen species (Populus tremula, Populus davidiana and Populus tremuloides) throughout the genome. Our results show substantial variation in these patterns along the genomes with this variation being strongly predicted by local recombination rates and the density of functional elements. This implies that the interaction between recurrent selection and intrinsic genomic features has dramatically sculpted the genomic landscape over long periods of time. In addition, our findings provide evidence that, apart from background selection, recent positive selection and long-term balancing selection have also been crucial components in shaping patterns of genome-wide variation during the speciation process.",

    "title": "Sequencing detects human papillomavirus in some apparently HPV-negative invasive cervical cancers.",
    "abstract": "Introduction. Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), but some cases may test HPV-negative. We previously tested 2850 Swedish cases and found that 394/2850 (13.8 %) cases tested HPV DNA-negative by PCR. Sequencing is the most thorough method to assess HPV status.Aim.. We wished to assess whether deep sequencing might detect HPV sequences among these HPV-negative cervical cancer specimens, and to increase the likelihood of detecting transcriptionally active infections.Methodology. Out of the 2850 cancer cases, we sequenced a random sample of 92 HPV PCR-negative cervical cancers and 34 HPV PCR-positive cervical cancers. Four pools of blank blocks were sequenced as negative controls. To enrich for mRNA - a hallmark of active viral infection - the samples were extracted, reverse-transcribed, rRNA-depleted and then sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina, USA). High-quality reads were aligned to the human genome and non-human reads were queried against HPV proteins.Results. We obtained a median of 23 million paired reads per sample. HPV was detected in 31/34 HPV PCR-positive cases. Among cases negative for HPV by PCR, 48/92 (52.2 %) contained HPV sequences, with HPV33 being the most commonly detected type among these (14/48 cases, 29.2 %). Comparison of the ratio of exon and intron sequences found that the sequenced material contained both DNA and RNA. Splice junctions were detected in 12 cases.Conclusion. Apparently, some cervical cancers contain HPV that is difficult to detect by PCR. Sequencing may be a helpful tool for additional quality assurance for HPV testing methods.",

    "title": "Novel fibronectin mutations and expansion of the phenotype in spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with \"corner fractures\".",
    "abstract": "Heterozygous pathogenic variants in the FN1 gene, encoding fibronectin (FN), have recently been shown to be associated with a skeletal disorder in some individuals affected by spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with \"corner fractures\" (SMD-CF). The most striking feature characterizing SMD-CF is irregularly shaped metaphyses giving the appearance of \"corner fractures\". An array of secondary features, including developmental coxa vara, ovoid vertebral bodies and severe scoliosis, may also be present. FN is an important extracellular matrix component for bone and cartilage development. Here we report five patients affected by this subtype of SMD-CF caused by five novel FN1 missense mutations: p.Cys123Tyr, p.Cys169Tyr, p.Cys213Tyr, p.Cys231Trp and p.Cys258Tyr. All individuals shared a substitution of a cysteine residue, disrupting disulfide bonds in the FN type-I assembly domains located in the N-terminal assembly region. The abnormal metaphyseal ossification and \"corner fracture\" appearances were the most remarkable clinical feature in these patients. In addition, generalized skeletal fragility with low-trauma bilateral femoral fractures was identified in one patient. Interestingly, the distal femoral changes in this patient healed with skeletal maturation. Our report expands the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of the FN1-related SMD-CF and emphasizes the importance of FN in bone formation and possibly also in the maintenance of bone strength.",

    "title": "Enhanced glycerol assimilation and lipid production in Rhodotorula toruloides CBS14 upon addition of hemicellulose primarily correlates with early transcription of energy-metabolism-related genes.",
    "abstract": "Lipid formation from glycerol was previously found to be activated in Rhodotorula toruloides when the yeast was cultivated in a mixture of crude glycerol (CG) and hemicellulose hydrolysate (CGHH) compared to CG as the only carbon source. RNA samples from R. toruloides CBS14 cell cultures grown on either CG or CGHH were collected at different timepoints of cultivation, and a differential gene expression analysis was performed between cells grown at a similar physiological situation.\n\nWe observed enhanced transcription of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and enzymes localized in mitochondria in CGHH compared to CG. Genes involved in protein turnover, including those encoding ribosomal proteins, translation elongation factors, and genes involved in building the proteasome also showed an enhanced transcription in CGHH compared to CG. At 10 h cultivation, another group of activated genes in CGHH was involved in Œ≤-oxidation, handling oxidative stress and degradation of xylose and aromatic compounds. Potential bypasses of the standard GUT1 and GUT2-glycerol assimilation pathway were also expressed and upregulated in CGHH 10 h. When the additional carbon sources from HH were completely consumed, at CGHH 36 h, their transcription decreased and NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was upregulated compared to CG 60 h, generating NADH instead of NADPH with glycerol catabolism. TPI1 was upregulated in CGHH compared to cells grown on CG in all physiological situations, potentially channeling the DHAP formed through glycerol catabolism into glycolysis. The highest number of upregulated genes encoding glycolytic enzymes was found after 36 h in CGHH, when all additional carbon sources were already consumed.\n\nWe suspect that the physiological reason for the accelerated glycerol assimilation and faster lipid production, was primarily the activation of enzymes that provide energy.",

    "title": "Neu-Laxova syndrome is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder caused by defects in enzymes of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway.",
    "abstract": "Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS) is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a recognizable pattern of severe malformations leading to prenatal or early postnatal lethality. Homozygous mutations in PHGDH, a gene involved in the first and limiting step in L-serine biosynthesis, were recently identified as the cause of the disease in three families. By studying a cohort of 12 unrelated families affected by NLS, we provide evidence that NLS is genetically heterogeneous and can be caused by mutations in all three genes encoding enzymes of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway. Consistent with recently reported findings, we could identify PHGDH missense mutations in three unrelated families of our cohort. Furthermore, we mapped an overlapping homozygous chromosome 9 region containing PSAT1 in four consanguineous families. This gene encodes phosphoserine aminotransferase, the enzyme for the second step in L-serine biosynthesis. We identified six families with three different missense and frameshift PSAT1 mutations fully segregating with the disease. In another family, we discovered a homozygous frameshift mutation in PSPH, the gene encoding phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step of L-serine biosynthesis. Interestingly, all three identified genes have been previously implicated in serine-deficiency disorders, characterized by variable neurological manifestations. Our findings expand our understanding of NLS as a disorder of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway and suggest that NLS represents the severe end of serine-deficiency disorders, demonstrating that certain complex syndromes characterized by early lethality could indeed be the extreme end of the phenotypic spectrum of already known disorders.",

    "abstract": "Spiral ganglion (SG) neurons of the cochlea convey all auditory inputs to the brain, yet the cellular and molecular complexity necessary to decode the various acoustic features in the SG has remained unresolved. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify four types of SG neurons, including three novel subclasses of type I neurons and the type II neurons, and provide a comprehensive genetic framework that define their potential synaptic communication patterns. The connectivity patterns of the three subclasses of type I neurons with inner hair cells and their electrophysiological profiles suggest that they represent the intensity-coding properties of auditory afferents. Moreover, neuron type specification is already established at birth, indicating a neuronal diversification process independent of neuronal activity. Thus, this work provides a transcriptional catalog of neuron types in the cochlea, which serves as a valuable resource for dissecting cell-type-specific functions of dedicated afferents in auditory perception and in hearing disorders.",

    "title": "Northwest African Neolithic initiated by migrants from Iberia and Levant.",
    "abstract": "In northwestern Africa, lifestyle transitioned from foraging to food production around 7,400 years ago but what sparked that change remains unclear. Archaeological data support conflicting views: (1) that migrant European Neolithic farmers brought the new way of life to North Africa1-3 or (2) that local hunter-gatherers adopted technological innovations4,5. The latter view is also supported by archaeogenetic data6. Here we fill key chronological and archaeogenetic gaps for the Maghreb, from Epipalaeolithic to Middle Neolithic, by sequencing the genomes of nine individuals (to between 45.8- and 0.2-fold genome coverage). Notably, we trace 8,000 years of population continuity and isolation from the Upper Palaeolithic, via the Epipaleolithic, to some Maghrebi Neolithic farming groups. However, remains from the earliest Neolithic contexts showed mostly European Neolithic ancestry. We suggest that farming was introduced by European migrants and was then rapidly adopted by local groups. During the Middle Neolithic a new ancestry from the Levant appears in the Maghreb, coinciding with the arrival of pastoralism in the region, and all three ancestries blend together during the Late Neolithic. Our results show ancestry shifts in the Neolithization of northwestern Africa that probably mirrored a heterogeneous economic and cultural landscape, in a more multifaceted process than observed in other regions.",

    "title": "Dissecting the genetic landscape of GPCR signaling through phenotypic profiling in C. elegans.",
    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate responses to various extracellular and intracellular cues. However, the large number of GPCR genes and their substantial functional redundancy make it challenging to systematically dissect GPCR functions in vivo. Here, we employ a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach, disrupting 1654 GPCR-encoding genes in 284 strains and mutating 152 neuropeptide-encoding genes in 38 strains in C. elegans. These two mutant libraries enable effective deorphanization of chemoreceptors, and characterization of receptors for neuropeptides in various cellular processes. Mutating a set of closely related GPCRs in a single strain permits the assignment of functions to GPCRs with functional redundancy. Our analyses identify a neuropeptide that interacts with three receptors in hypoxia-evoked locomotory responses, unveil a collection of regulators in pathogen-induced immune responses, and define receptors for the volatile food-related odorants. These results establish our GPCR and neuropeptide mutant libraries as valuable resources for the C. elegans community to expedite studies of GPCR signaling in multiple contexts.",

    "title": "Genomic architecture of migration timing in a long-distance migratory songbird.",
    "abstract": "The impact of climate change on spring phenology poses risks to migratory birds, as migration timing is controlled predominantly by endogenous mechanisms. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the underlying genetic basis of migration timing, the ways that migration timing phenotypes in wild individuals may map to specific genomic regions requires further investigation. We examined the genetic architecture of migration timing in a long-distance migratory songbird (purple martin, Progne subis subis) by integrating genomic data with an extensive dataset of direct migratory tracks. A moderate to large amount of variance in spring migration arrival timing was explained by genomics (proportion of phenotypic variation explained by genomics = 0.74; polygenic score R2 = 0.24). On chromosome 1, a region that was differentiated between migration timing phenotypes contained genes that could facilitate nocturnal flights and act as epigenetic modifiers. Overall, these results advance our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of migration timing.",

    "title": "Genetic Landscape of the ACE2 Coronavirus Receptor.",
    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, enters human cells using the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein as a receptor. ACE2 is thus key to the infection and treatment of the coronavirus. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, playing important regulatory roles in the cardiovascular and other biological systems. However, the genetic basis of the ACE2 protein levels is not well understood.\n\nWe have conducted the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of plasma ACE2 levels in >28 000 individuals of the SCALLOP Consortium (Systematic and Combined Analysis of Olink Proteins). We summarize the cross-sectional epidemiological correlates of circulating ACE2. Using the summary statistics-based high-definition likelihood method, we estimate relevant genetic correlations with cardiometabolic phenotypes, COVID-19, and other human complex traits and diseases. We perform causal inference of soluble ACE2 on vascular disease outcomes and COVID-19 severity using mendelian randomization. We also perform in silico functional analysis by integrating with other types of omics data.\n\nWe identified 10 loci, including 8 novel, capturing 30% of the heritability of the protein. We detected that plasma ACE2 was genetically correlated with vascular diseases, severe COVID-19, and a wide range of human complex diseases and medications. An X-chromosome cis-protein quantitative trait loci-based mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of elevated ACE2 levels on COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.10-2.42]; P=0.01), hospitalization (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.05-2.21]; P=0.03), and infection (odds ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.08-2.37]; P=0.02). Tissue- and cell type-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis revealed that the ACE2 regulatory variants were enriched for DNA methylation sites in blood immune cells.\n\nHuman plasma ACE2 shares a genetic basis with cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, and other related diseases. The genetic architecture of the ACE2 protein is mapped, providing a useful resource for further biological and clinical studies on this coronavirus receptor.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial processes necessary for adaption to stressful host environments are potential targets for new antimicrobials. Here, we report large-scale transcriptomic analyses of 32 human bacterial pathogens grown under 11 stress conditions mimicking human host environments. The potential relevance of the in vitro stress conditions and responses is supported by comparisons with available in vivo transcriptomes of clinically important pathogens. Calculation of a probability score enables comparative cross-microbial analyses of the stress responses, revealing common and unique regulatory responses to different stresses, as well as overlapping processes participating in different stress responses. We identify conserved and species-specific 'universal stress responders', that is, genes showing altered expression in multiple stress conditions. Non-coding RNAs are involved in a substantial proportion of the responses. The data are collected in a freely available, interactive online resource (PATHOgenex).",

    "title": "Features of increased malignancy in eosinophilic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of renal cancer. Due to inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are constitutively activated in these tumours, resulting in a pseudo-hypoxic phenotype. The HIFs induce the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and cell survival, but they also reset the cellular metabolism to protect cells from oxygen and nutrient deprivation. ccRCC tumours are highly vascularized and the cytoplasm of the cancer cells is filled with lipid droplets and glycogen, resulting in the histologically distinctive pale (clear) cytoplasm. Intratumoural heterogeneity may occur, and in some tumours, areas with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm are found. Little is known regarding these traits and how they relate to the coexistent clear cell component, yet eosinophilic ccRCC is associated with higher grade and clinically more aggressive tumours. In this study, we have for the first time performed RNA sequencing comparing histologically verified clear cell and eosinophilic areas from ccRCC tissue, aiming to analyse the characteristics of these cell types. Findings from RNA sequencing were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of biphasic ccRCC. We found that the eosinophilic phenotype displayed a higher proliferative drive and lower differentiation, and we confirmed a correlation to tumours of higher stage. We further identified mutations of the tumour suppressor p53 (TP53) exclusively in the eosinophilic ccRCC component, where mTORC1 activity was also elevated. Also, eosinophilic areas were less vascularized, yet harboured more abundant infiltrating immune cells. The cytoplasm of clear cell ccRCC cells was filled with lipids but had very low mitochondrial content, while the reverse was found in eosinophilic tissue. We herein suggest possible transcriptional mechanisms behind these phenomena. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases. This study aimed to examine the effects of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antidiabetic drugs on biological aging. We included 672 participants and 2746 repeated measurements from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Self-reported medicine uses were categorized into antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs. A total of 12 biomarkers for biological aging (BA biomarkers) were included as outcomes. Conditional generalized estimating equations were applied conditioning on individuals to estimate the drug effect on BA biomarker level within the same person when using or not using the drug. Chronological age, body mass index, smoking status, number of multiple medication uses, blood pressure, blood glucose level, and apoB/apoA ratio were adjusted for as covariates in the model. Overall, using antihypertensive drugs was associated with a decrease in one DNA-methylation age (PCGrimAge: beta = - 0.39, 95%CI = - 0.67 to - 0.12). When looking into drug subcategories, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were associated with a decrease in several DNA-methylation ages (PCHorvathAge beta = - 1.28, 95%CI = - 2.34 to - 0.21; PCSkin&bloodAge beta = - 1.34, 95%CI = - 2.61 to - 0.07; PCPhenoAge beta = - 1.74, 95%CI = - 2.58 to - 0.89; PCGrimAge beta = - 0.57, 95%CI = - 0.96 to - 0.17) and in functional biological ages (functional age index beta = - 2.18, 95%CI = - 3.65 to - 0.71; frailty index beta = - 1.31, 95%CI = - 2.43 to - 0.18). However, the results within other drug subcategories were inconsistent. Calcium channel blockers may decrease biological aging captured by the BA biomarkers measured at epigenetic and functional level. Future studies are warranted to confirm these effects and understand the underlying biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The cytokine transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) regulates the development and homeostasis of several tissue-resident macrophage populations, including microglia. TGF-Œ≤ is not critical for microglia survival but is required for the maintenance of the microglia-specific homeostatic gene signature1,2. Under defined host conditions, circulating monocytes can compete for the microglial niche and give rise to long-lived monocyte-derived macrophages residing in the central nervous system (CNS)3-5. Whether monocytes require TGF-Œ≤ for colonization of the microglial niche and maintenance of CNS integrity is unknown. We found that abrogation of TGF-Œ≤ signaling in CX3CR1+ monocyte-derived macrophages led to rapid onset of a progressive and fatal demyelinating motor disease characterized by myelin-laden giant macrophages throughout the spinal cord. Tgfbr2-deficient macrophages were characterized by high expression of genes encoding proteins involved in antigen presentation, inflammation and phagocytosis. TGF-Œ≤ is thus crucial for the functional integration of monocytes into the CNS microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "The impact of the microenvironment on innate lymphoid cell (ILC)-mediated immunity in humans remains largely unknown. Here we used full-length Smart-seq2 single-cell RNA-sequencing to unravel tissue-specific transcriptional profiles and heterogeneity of CD127+ ILCs across four human tissues. Correlation analysis identified gene modules characterizing the migratory properties of tonsil and blood ILCs, and signatures of tissue-residency, activation and modified metabolism in colon and lung ILCs. Trajectory analysis revealed potential differentiation pathways from circulating and tissue-resident na√Øve ILCs to a spectrum of mature ILC subsets. In the lung we identified both CRTH2+ and CRTH2- ILC2 with lung-specific signatures, which could be recapitulated by alarmin-exposure of circulating ILC2. Finally, we describe unique TCR-V(D)J-rearrangement patterns of blood ILC1-like cells, revealing a subset of potentially immature ILCs with TCR-Œ¥ rearrangement. Our study provides a useful resource for in-depth understanding of ILC-mediated immunity in humans, with implications for disease.",

    "title": "The evolutionary and phylogeographic history of woolly mammoths: a comprehensive mitogenomic analysis.",
    "abstract": "Near the end of the Pleistocene epoch, populations of the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) were distributed across parts of three continents, from western Europe and northern Asia through Beringia to the Atlantic seaboard of North America. Nonetheless, questions about the connectivity and temporal continuity of mammoth populations and species remain unanswered. We use a combination of targeted enrichment and high-throughput sequencing to assemble and interpret a data set of 143 mammoth mitochondrial genomes, sampled from fossils recovered from across their Holarctic range. Our dataset includes 54 previously unpublished mitochondrial genomes and significantly increases the coverage of the Eurasian range of the species. The resulting global phylogeny confirms that the Late Pleistocene mammoth population comprised three distinct mitochondrial lineages that began to diverge ~1.0-2.0 million years ago (Ma). We also find that mammoth mitochondrial lineages were strongly geographically partitioned throughout the Pleistocene. In combination, our genetic results and the pattern of morphological variation in time and space suggest that male-mediated gene flow, rather than large-scale dispersals, was important in the Pleistocene evolutionary history of mammoths.",

The heath hare has a unique grey winter pelage as compared to other mountain hares (white) and brown hares (mostly brown), and face regional extinction, likely due to competitive exclusion from the non-native brown hare. Whole genome resequencing from the seven hare specimens were mapped to the Lepus timidus pseudoreference genome and used for detection of 11,363,883 polymorphic nucleotide positions. The data presented here could be useful for addressing local adaptations and conservation status of mountain hares and brown hares in Sweden, including unique subspecies.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal Peyer's patches (PPs) form unique niches for bacteria-immune cell interactions that direct host immunity and shape the microbiome. Here we investigate how peroral administration of probiotic bacterium Limosilactobacillus reuteri R2LC affects B lymphocytes and IgA induction in the PPs, as well as the downstream consequences on intestinal microbiota and susceptibility to inflammation.\n\nThe B cells of PPs were separated by size to circumvent activation-dependent cell identification biases due to dynamic expression of markers, which resulted in two phenotypically, transcriptionally, and spatially distinct subsets: small IgD+/GL7-/S1PR1+/Bcl6, CCR6-expressing pre-germinal center (GC)-like B cells with innate-like functions located subepithelially, and large GL7+/S1PR1-/Ki67+/Bcl6, CD69-expressing B cells with strong metabolic activity found in the GC. Peroral L. reuteri administration expanded both B cell subsets and enhanced the innate-like properties of pre-GC-like B cells while retaining them in the sub-epithelial compartment by increased sphingosine-1-phosphate/S1PR1 signaling. Furthermore, L. reuteri promoted GC-like B cell differentiation, which involved expansion of the GC area and autocrine TGFŒ≤-1 activation. Consequently, PD-1-T follicular helper cell-dependent IgA induction and production was increased by L. reuteri, which shifted the intestinal microbiome and protected against dextran-sulfate-sodium induced colitis and dysbiosis.\n\nThe Peyer's patches sense, enhance and transmit probiotic signals by increasing the numbers and effector functions of distinct B cell subsets, resulting in increased IgA production, altered intestinal microbiota, and protection against inflammation.

    "title": "Leucine Biosynthesis Is Involved in Regulating High Lipid Accumulation in Yarrowia lipolytica.",
    "abstract": "The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a potent accumulator of lipids, and lipogenesis in this organism can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as genetics and environmental conditions. Using a multifactorial study, we elucidated the effects of both genetic and environmental factors on regulation of lipogenesis in Y.¬†lipolytica and identified how two opposite regulatory states both result in lipid accumulation. This study involved comparison of a strain overexpressing diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGA1) with a control strain grown under either nitrogen or carbon limitation conditions. A strong correlation was observed between the responses on the transcript and protein levels. Combination of DGA1 overexpression with nitrogen limitation resulted in a high level of lipid accumulation accompanied by downregulation of several amino acid biosynthetic pathways, including that of leucine in particular, and these changes were further correlated with a decrease in metabolic fluxes. This downregulation was supported by the measured decrease in the level of 2-isopropylmalate, an intermediate of leucine biosynthesis. Combining the multi-omics data with putative transcription factor binding motifs uncovered a contradictory role for TORC1 in controlling lipid accumulation, likely mediated through 2-isopropylmalate and a Leu3-like transcription factor.IMPORTANCE The ubiquitous metabolism of lipids involves refined regulation, and an enriched understanding of this regulation would have wide implications. Various factors can influence lipid metabolism, including the environment and genetics. We demonstrated, using a multi-omics and multifactorial experimental setup, that multiple factors affect lipid accumulation in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica Using integrative analysis, we identified novel interactions between nutrient restriction and genetic factors involving regulators that are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Given that lipid metabolism is involved in many diseases but is also vital to the development of microbial cell factories that can provide us with sustainable fuels and oleochemicals, we envision that our report introduces foundational work to further unravel the regulation of lipid accumulation in eukaryal cells.",

    "title": "Chromosome-level genome assembly of Lilford's wall lizard, Podarcis lilfordi (G√ºnther, 1874) from the Balearic Islands (Spain).",
    "abstract": "The Mediterranean lizard Podarcis lilfordi is an emblematic species of the Balearic Islands. The extensive phenotypic diversity among extant isolated populations makes the species a great insular model system for eco-evolutionary studies, as well as a challenging target for conservation management plans. Here we report the first high-quality chromosome-level assembly and annotation of the P. lilfordi genome, along with its mitogenome, based on a mixed sequencing strategy (10X Genomics linked reads, Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads and Hi-C scaffolding) coupled with extensive transcriptomic data (Illumina and PacBio). The genome assembly (1.5 Gb) is highly contiguous (N50 = 90 Mb) and complete, with 99% of the sequence assigned to candidate chromosomal sequences and >97% gene completeness. We annotated a total of 25,663 protein-coding genes translating into 38,615 proteins. Comparison to the genome of the related species Podarcis muralis revealed substantial similarity in genome size, annotation metrics, repeat content, and a strong collinearity, despite their evolutionary distance (~18-20 MYA). This genome expands the repertoire of available reptilian genomes and will facilitate the exploration of the molecular and evolutionary processes underlying the extraordinary phenotypic diversity of this insular species, while providing a critical resource for conservation genomics.",

    "title": "Systems-level immunomonitoring in children with solid tumors to enable precision medicine.",
    "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of death from disease in children. Survival depends not only on surgery, cytostatic drugs, and radiation but also on systemic immune responses. Factors influencing these immune responses in children of different ages and tumor types are unknown. Novel immunotherapies can enhance anti-tumor immune responses, but few children have benefited, and markers of effective responses are lacking. Here, we present a systems-level analysis of immune responses in 191 children within a population-based cohort with diverse tumors and reveal that age and tumor type shape immune responses differently. Systemic inflammation and cytotoxic T cell responses correlate with tumor mutation rates and immune cell infiltration. Clonally expanded T cell responses are rarely detected in blood or tumors at diagnosis but are sometimes elicited during treatment. Expanded T cells are similarly regulated in children and adults with more immunogenic cancers. This research aims to facilitate the development of precision immunotherapies for children with cancer.",

    "title": "Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of hoarding symptoms in 27,537 individuals.",
    "abstract": "Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a mental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties discarding or parting with possessions, often resulting in cluttered living spaces, distress, and impairment. Its etiology is largely unknown, but twin studies suggest that it is moderately heritable. In this study, we pooled phenotypic and genomic data from seven international cohorts (N = 27,537 individuals) and conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of parent- or self-reported hoarding symptoms (HS). We followed up the results with gene-based and gene-set analyses, as well as leave-one-out HS polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses. To examine a possible genetic association between hoarding symptoms and other phenotypes we conducted cross-trait PRS analyses. Though we did not report any genome-wide significant SNPs, we report heritability estimates for the twin-cohorts between 26-48%, and a SNP-heritability of 11% for an unrelated sub-cohort. Cross-trait PRS analyses showed that the genetic risk for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder were significantly associated with hoarding symptoms. We also found suggestive evidence for an association with educational attainment. There were no significant associations with other phenotypes previously linked to HD, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. To conclude, we found that HS are heritable, confirming and extending previous twin studies but we had limited power to detect any genome-wide significant loci. Much larger samples will be needed to further extend these findings and reach a \"gene discovery zone\". To move the field forward, future research should not only include genetic analyses of quantitative hoarding traits in larger samples, but also in samples of individuals meeting strict diagnostic criteria for HD, and more ethnically diverse samples.",

    "title": "Colonial-driven extinction of the blue antelope despite genomic adaptation to low population size.",
    "abstract": "Low genomic diversity is generally indicative of small population size and is considered detrimental by decreasing long-term adaptability.1,2,3,4,5,6 Moreover, small population size may promote gene flow with congeners and outbreeding depression.7,8,9,10,11,12,13 Here, we examine the connection between habitat availability, effective population size (Ne), and extinction by generating a 40√ó nuclear genome from the extinct blue antelope (Hippotragus leucophaeus). Historically endemic to the relatively small Cape Floristic Region in southernmost Africa,14,15 populations were thought to have expanded and contracted across glacial-interglacial cycles, tracking suitable habitat.16,17,18 However, we found long-term low Ne, unaffected by glacial cycles, suggesting persistence with low genomic diversity for many millennia prior to extinction in ‚àºAD 1800. A lack of inbreeding, alongside high levels of genetic purging, suggests adaptation to this long-term low Ne and that human impacts during the colonial era (e.g., hunting and landscape transformation), rather than longer-term ecological processes, were central to its extinction. Phylogenomic analyses uncovered gene flow between roan (H. equinus) and blue antelope, as well as between roan and sable antelope (H. niger), approximately at the time of divergence of blue and sable antelope (‚àº1.9 Ma). Finally, we identified the LYST and ASIP genes as candidates for the eponymous bluish pelt color of the blue antelope. Our results revise numerous aspects of our understanding of the interplay between genomic diversity and evolutionary history and provide the resources for uncovering the genetic basis of this extinct species' unique traits.",

    "title": "Early Pleistocene enamel proteome from Dmanisi resolves Stephanorhinus phylogeny.",
    "abstract": "The sequencing of ancient DNA has enabled the reconstruction of speciation, migration and admixture events for extinct taxa1. However, the irreversible post-mortem degradation2 of ancient DNA has so far limited its recovery-outside permafrost areas-to specimens that are not older than approximately 0.5 million years (Myr)3. By contrast, tandem mass spectrometry has enabled the sequencing of approximately 1.5-Myr-old collagen type I4, and suggested the presence of protein residues in fossils of the Cretaceous period5-although with limited phylogenetic use6. In the absence of molecular evidence, the speciation of several extinct species of the Early and Middle Pleistocene epoch remains contentious. Here we address the phylogenetic relationships of the Eurasian Rhinocerotidae of the Pleistocene epoch7-9, using the proteome of dental enamel from a Stephanorhinus tooth that is approximately 1.77-Myr old, recovered from the archaeological site of Dmanisi (South Caucasus, Georgia)10. Molecular phylogenetic analyses place this Stephanorhinus as a sister group to the clade formed by the woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) and Merck's rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis). We show that Coelodonta evolved from an early Stephanorhinus lineage, and that this latter genus includes at least two distinct evolutionary lines. The genus Stephanorhinus is therefore currently paraphyletic, and its systematic revision is needed. We demonstrate that sequencing the proteome of Early Pleistocene dental enamel overcomes the limitations of phylogenetic inference based on ancient collagen or DNA. Our approach also provides additional information about the sex and taxonomic assignment of other specimens from Dmanisi. Our findings reveal that proteomic investigation of ancient dental enamel-which is the hardest tissue in vertebrates11, and is highly abundant in the fossil record-can push the reconstruction of molecular evolution further back into the Early Pleistocene epoch, beyond the currently known limits of ancient DNA preservation.",

    "title": "Pyramiding of scald resistance genes in four spring barley MAGIC populations.",
    "abstract": "Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of four Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) populations identified nine regions on chromosomes 1H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H and 7H associated with resistance against barley scald disease. Three of these regions are putatively novel resistance Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). Barley scald is caused by Rhynchosporium commune, one of the most important barley leaf diseases that are prevalent in most barley-growing regions. Up to 40% yield losses can occur in susceptible barley cultivars. Four MAGIC populations were generated in a Nordic Public-Private Pre-breeding of spring barley project (PPP Barley) to introduce resistance to several important diseases. Here, these MAGIC populations consisting of six to eight founders each were tested for scald resistance in field trials in Finland and Iceland. Eight different model covariate combinations were compared for GWAS studies, and the models that deviated the least from the expected p-values were selected. For all QTL, candidate genes were identified that are predicted to be involved in pathogen defence. The MAGIC progenies contained new haplotypes of significant SNP-markers with high resistance levels. The lines with successfully pyramided resistance against scald and mildew and the significant markers are now distributed among Nordic plant breeders and will benefit development of disease-resistant cultivars.",

    "title": "Whole genome duplication in coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and its implications for explaining the rarity of polyploidy in conifers.",
    "abstract": "Polyploidy is common and an important evolutionary factor in most land plant lineages, but it is rare in gymnosperms. Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is one of just two polyploid conifer species and the only hexaploid. Evidence from fossil guard cell size suggests that polyploidy in Sequoia dates to the Eocene. Numerous hypotheses about the mechanism of polyploidy and parental genome donors have been proposed, based primarily on morphological and cytological data, but it remains unclear how Sequoia became polyploid and why this lineage overcame an apparent gymnosperm barrier to whole-genome duplication (WGD). We sequenced transcriptomes and used phylogenetic inference, Bayesian concordance analysis and paralog age distributions to resolve relationships among gene copies in hexaploid coast redwood and close relatives. Our data show that hexaploidy in coast redwood is best explained by autopolyploidy or, if there was allopolyploidy, it happened within the Californian redwood clade. We found that duplicate genes have more similar sequences than expected, given the age of the inferred polyploidization. Conflict between molecular and fossil estimates of WGD can be explained if diploidization occurred very slowly following polyploidization. We extrapolate from this to suggest that the rarity of polyploidy in gymnosperms may be due to slow diploidization in this clade.",
