    "title": "A Genome-Wide Association Study of Bisphosphonate-Associated Atypical Femoral Fracture.",
    "abstract": "Atypical femoral fracture is a well-documented adverse reaction to bisphosphonates. It is strongly related to duration of bisphosphonate use, and the risk declines rapidly after drug withdrawal. The mechanism behind bisphosphonate-associated atypical femoral fracture is unclear, but a genetic predisposition has been suggested. With the aim to identify common genetic variants that could be used for preemptive genetic testing, we performed a genome-wide association study. Cases were recruited mainly through reports of adverse drug reactions sent to the Swedish Medical Products Agency on a nation-wide basis. We compared atypical femoral fracture cases (n = 51) with population-based controls (n = 4891), and to reduce the possibility of confounding by indication, we also compared with bisphosphonate-treated controls without a current diagnosis of cancer (n = 324). The total number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms after imputation was 7,585,874. A genome-wide significance threshold of p < 5 × 10\n            -8 was used to correct for multiple testing. In addition, we performed candidate gene analyses for a panel of 29 genes previously implicated in atypical femoral fractures (significance threshold of p < 5.7 × 10-6). Compared with population controls, bisphosphonate-associated atypical femoral fracture was associated with four isolated, uncommon single-nucleotide polymorphisms. When cases were compared with bisphosphonate-treated controls, no statistically significant genome-wide association remained. We conclude that the detected associations were either false positives or related to the underlying disease, i.e., treatment indication. Furthermore, there was no significant association with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 29 candidate genes. In conclusion, this study found no evidence of a common genetic predisposition for bisphosphonate-associated atypical femoral fracture. Further studies of larger sample size to identify possible weakly associated genetic traits, as well as whole exome or whole-genome sequencing studies to identify possible rare genetic variation conferring a risk are warranted.",

    "title": "A recently isolated human commensal Escherichia coli ST10 clone member mediates enhanced thermotolerance and tetrathionate respiration on a P1 phage-derived IncY plasmid.",
    "abstract": "The ubiquitous human commensal Escherichia coli has been well investigated through its model representative E. coli K-12. In this work, we initially characterized E. coli Fec10, a recently isolated human commensal strain of phylogroup A/sequence type ST10. Compared to E. coli K-12, the 4.88 Mbp Fec10 genome is characterized by distinct single-nucleotide polymorphisms and acquisition of genomic islands. In addition, E. coli Fec10 possesses a 155.86 kbp IncY plasmid, a composite element based on phage P1. pFec10 harbours multiple cargo genes such as coding for a tetrathionate reductase and its corresponding regulatory two-component system. Among the cargo genes is also the Transmissible Locus of Protein Quality Control (TLPQC), which mediates tolerance to lethal temperatures in bacteria. The disaggregase ClpGGI of TLPQC constitutes a major determinant of the thermotolerance of E. coli Fec10. We confirmed stand-alone disaggregation activity, but observed distinct biochemical characteristics of ClpGGI-Fec10 compared to the nearly identical Pseudomonas aeruginosa ClpGGI-SG17M. Furthermore, we noted a unique contribution of ClpGGI-Fec10 to the exquisite thermotolerance of E. coli Fec10, suggesting functional differences between both disaggregases in vivo. Detection of thermotolerance in 10% of human commensal E. coli isolates hints to the successful establishment of food-borne heat-resistant strains in the human gut.",

    "title": "Effect of anode material and dispersal limitation on the performance and biofilm community in microbial electrolysis cells.",
    "abstract": "In a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), the oxidization of organic compounds is facilitated by an electrogenic biofilm on the anode surface. The biofilm community composition determines the function of the system. Both deterministic and stochastic factors affect the community, but the relative importance of different factors is poorly understood. Anode material is a deterministic factor as materials with different properties may select for different microorganisms. Ecological drift is a stochastic factor, which is amplified by dispersal limitation between communities. Here, we compared the effects of three anode materials (graphene, carbon cloth, and nickel) with the effect of dispersal limitation on the function and biofilm community assembly. Twelve MECs were operated for 56 days in four hydraulically connected loops and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to analyse the microbial community composition on the anode surfaces at the end of the experiment. The anode material was the most important factor affecting the performance of the MECs, explaining 54-80 % of the variance observed in peak current density, total electric charge generation, and start-up lag time, while dispersal limitation explained 10-16 % of the variance. Carbon cloth anodes had the highest current generation and shortest lag time. However, dispersal limitation was the most important factor affecting microbial community structure, explaining 61-98 % of the variance in community diversity, evenness, and the relative abundance of the most abundant taxa, while anode material explained 0-20 % of the variance. The biofilms contained nine Desulfobacterota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), which made up 64-89 % of the communities and were likely responsible for electricity generation in the MECs. Different MAGs dominated in different MECs. Particularly two different genotypes related to Geobacter benzoatilyticus competed for dominance on the anodes and reached relative abundances up to 83 %. The winning genotype was the same in all MECs that were hydraulically connected irrespective of anode material used.",

    "title": "Variant Profiling of Candidate Genes in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis. Variant profiling is crucial for developing personalized treatment and elucidating the etiology of this disease.\n\nPatients with PDAC undergoing surgery from 2007 to 2012 (n = 73) were followed from diagnosis until death or the end of the study. We applied an anchored multiplex PCR (AMP)-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) method to a panel of 65 selected genes and assessed analytical performance by sequencing a quantitative multiplex DNA reference standard. In clinical PDAC samples, detection of low-level KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations was validated by allele-specific PCR and digital PCR. We compared overall survival of patients according to KRAS mutation status by log-rank test and applied logistic regression to evaluate the association between smoking and tumor variant types.\n\nThe AMP-based NGS method could detect variants with allele frequencies as low as 1% given sufficient sequencing depth (>1500×). Low-frequency KRAS G12 mutations (allele frequency 1%-5%) were all confirmed by allele-specific PCR and digital PCR. The most prevalent genetic alterations were in KRAS (78% of patients), TP53 (tumor protein p53) (25%), and SMAD4 (SMAD family member 4) (8%). Overall survival in T3-stage PDAC patients differed among KRAS mutation subtypes (P = 0.019). Transversion variants were more common in ever-smokers than in never-smokers (odds ratio 5.7; 95% CI 1.2-27.8).\n\nThe AMP-based NGS method is applicable for profiling tumor variants. Using this approach, we demonstrated that in PDAC patients, KRAS mutant subtype G12V is associated with poorer survival, and that transversion variants are more common among smokers.",

    "title": "Evolutionary engineering reveals divergent paths when yeast is adapted to different acidic environments.",
    "abstract": "Tolerance of yeast to acid stress is important for many industrial processes including organic acid production. Therefore, elucidating the molecular basis of long term adaptation to acidic environments will be beneficial for engineering production strains to thrive under such harsh conditions. Previous studies using gene expression analysis have suggested that both organic and inorganic acids display similar responses during short term exposure to acidic conditions. However, biological mechanisms that will lead to long term adaptation of yeast to acidic conditions remains unknown and whether these mechanisms will be similar for tolerance to both organic and inorganic acids is yet to be explored. We therefore evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae to acquire tolerance to HCl (inorganic acid) and to 0.3M L-lactic acid (organic acid) at pH 2.8 and then isolated several low pH tolerant strains. Whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq analysis of the evolved strains revealed different sets of genome alterations suggesting a divergence in adaptation to these two acids. An altered sterol composition and impaired iron uptake contributed to HCl tolerance whereas the formation of a multicellular morphology and rapid lactate degradation was crucial for tolerance to high concentrations of lactic acid. Our findings highlight the contribution of both the selection pressure and nature of the acid as a driver for directing the evolutionary path towards tolerance to low pH. The choice of carbon source was also an important factor in the evolutionary process since cells evolved on two different carbon sources (raffinose and glucose) generated a different set of mutations in response to the presence of lactic acid. Therefore, different strategies are required for a rational design of low pH tolerant strains depending on the acid of interest.",

    "abstract": "As the non-coding genome remains poorly characterized in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we aimed to identify and functionally characterize novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) relevant to AML biology and treatment. We first identified lncRNAs overexpressed in AML blasts and, among them, discovered a novel transcript, which we named myeloid and AML-associated intergenic long non-coding RNA (MALNC). MALNC is overexpressed in AML, particularly in cases with the PML-RARA fusion or IDH2R140/NPM1 co-mutations, and is associated with a distinct gene expression profile. Functional studies showed that MALNC knockout impairs AML cell proliferation and colony formation, enhances ATRA-induced differentiation, and sensitizes cells to arsenic trioxide. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MALNC loss alters the expression of retinoic acid pathway genes, and chromatin binding studies showed that MALNC binds to genes related to the retinoic acid and Rho GTPase pathways. In conclusion, we have identified MALNC as a novel lncRNA that promotes leukemic cell proliferation, counteracts ATRA-induced differentiation, and modulates drug sensitivity in AML.",

    "abstract": "Neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) is formed by microbial methylation of inorganic divalent Hg (HgII) and constitutes severe environmental and human health risks. The methylation is enabled by hgcA and hgcB genes, but it is not known if the associated molecular-level processes are rate-limiting or enable accurate prediction of MeHg formation in nature. In this study, we investigated the relationships between hgc genes and MeHg across redox-stratified water columns in the brackish Baltic Sea. We showed, for the first time, that hgc transcript abundance and the concentration of dissolved HgII-sulfide species were strong predictors of both the HgII methylation rate and MeHg concentration, implying their roles as principal joint drivers of MeHg formation in these systems. Additionally, we characterized the metabolic capacities of hgc+ microorganisms by reconstructing their genomes from metagenomes (i.e., hgc+ MAGs), which highlighted the versatility of putative HgII methylators in the water column of the Baltic Sea. In establishing relationships between hgc transcripts and the HgII methylation rate, we advance the fundamental understanding of mechanistic principles governing MeHg formation in nature and enable refined predictions of MeHg levels in coastal seas in response to the accelerating spread of oxygen-deficient zones.",

    "title": "Consequences of past climate change and recent human persecution on mitogenomic diversity in the arctic fox.",
    "abstract": "Ancient DNA provides a powerful means to investigate the timing, rate and extent of population declines caused by extrinsic factors, such as past climate change and human activities. One species probably affected by both these factors is the arctic fox, which had a large distribution during the last glaciation that subsequently contracted at the start of the Holocene. More recently, the arctic fox population in Scandinavia went through a demographic bottleneck owing to human persecution. To investigate the consequences of these processes, we generated mitogenome sequences from a temporal dataset comprising Pleistocene, historical and modern arctic fox samples. We found no evidence that Pleistocene populations in mid-latitude Europe or Russia contributed to the present-day gene pool of the Scandinavian population, suggesting that postglacial climate warming led to local population extinctions. Furthermore, during the twentieth-century bottleneck in Scandinavia, at least half of the mitogenome haplotypes were lost, consistent with a 20-fold reduction in female effective population size. In conclusion, these results suggest that the arctic fox in mainland Western Europe has lost genetic diversity as a result of both past climate change and human persecution. Consequently, it might be particularly vulnerable to the future challenges posed by climate change. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The past is a foreign country: how much can the fossil record actually inform conservation?'",

    "title": "Implications of baseline polymorphisms for potential resistance to NS3 protease inhibitors in Hepatitis C virus genotypes 1a, 2b and 3a.",
    "abstract": "The future interferon-free treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could include NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs) for potent pan-genotypic effect. We studied the prevalence of pre-existing PI resistance associated amino acid variants (RAVs) in 126 treatment-naive patient samples of HCV genotypes 1a, 2b and 3a, the most common genotypes in Sweden. The NS3 genes were each amplified by nested PCR method with degenerated primers to enable a broad genotype analysis. Population sequencing method was used, and the sequences were aligned with the NS3 sequence from HCV genotype 1a H77 strain. Interpretation of fold-change resistance to NS3 candidate drugs were done from already published phenotypic resistance data. The prevalence of known PI RAVs at baseline in genotype 1a was 28% (15/53), either single (V36L or Q80K/R) or combinations (T54A/S and V55A/I) of mutation(s). In genotype 2b, specific mutations like V36L, Q80G and S122R of viral NS3 protease gene were found in 100% (11/11). These may be the natural polymorphisms unique to genotype 2b. Similarly, specific mutations like V36L and D168Q were found uniquely in all 3a samples (30/30). The natural PI RAVs found in genotype 1a, although with relatively weak resistance, could still render up to 10-fold-resistance to the approved (boceprevir and telaprevir) and the 2nd generation PIs (faldaprevir and simeprevir). Moreover, the natural polymorphisms in genotype 2b (i.e. S122R) and 3a (i.e. D168Q), with inherent PI drug resistance of up to 20 and 700 fold respectively, would explain why current PIs are primarily directed against genotype 1.",

    "title": "Genome-wide identification of modulators of Chlamydia trachomatis parasitophorous vacuole stability highlights an important role for sphingolipid supply.",
    "abstract": "A mechanistic understanding of how intracellular pathogens evade the intrinsic defenses of their host cells could open up intriguing therapeutic opportunities. Here, we applied a genome-wide genetic screening approach to investigate the nature of the defensive host cell death response suppressed by the membrane trafficking modulator CpoS, an effector protein secreted by the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. Initially, this work revealed a CpoS-deficient mutant to exhibit a markedly increased dependence on host cellular synthesis of ceramides, the precursors of complex sphingolipids. Using novel microscopic reporters, we then established CpoS' role in defense evasion to occur by preserving the integrity of Chlamydia's parasitophorous vacuole (the inclusion) via ensuring an adequate sphingolipid supply. More specifically, we observed CpoS deficiency to destabilize inclusions, initially characterized by a release of individual bacteria into the host cell cytosol, then followed by inclusion rupture concomitant with host cell death. Exogenous addition of sphingosine stabilized CpoS-deficient inclusions, whereas disruption of host cellular ceramide synthesis destabilized wild-type inclusions. In combination, CpoS deficiency and impaired ceramide synthesis - presumably disrupting both Chlamydia's vesicular and non-vesicular sphingolipid supply routes - destabilized inclusions even earlier, resulting in infection clearance and host cell survival rather than host cell death. Overall, this study highlights how the vacuolar pathogen C. trachomatis maintains vacuole integrity by ensuring a steady sphingolipid supply, potentially offering inspiration and directions for future therapeutic strategies targeting parasitophorous vacuoles.",

    "title": "Oral-gut microbiome interactions in advanced cirrhosis: characterisation of pathogenic enterotypes and salivatypes, virulence factors and antimicrobial.",
    "abstract": "Cirrhosis complications are often triggered by bacterial infections with multidrug-resistant organisms. Alterations in the gut and oral microbiome in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) influence clinical outcomes. We interrogated: (i) gut and oral microbiome community structures, (ii) virulence factors (VFs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and (iii) oral-gut microbial overlap in patients with differing cirrhosis severity.\n\n15 healthy controls (HC), 26 stable cirrhosis (SC), 46 DC, 14 acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 14 with severe infection without cirrhosis (NLS) participated. Metagenomic sequencing was undertaken on paired saliva (S) and faecal (F) samples. 'Salivatypes' and 'enterotypes' based on genera clustering were assessed against cirrhosis severity and clinical parameters. VFs and ARGs were evaluated in oral and gut niches, and distinct resistotypes identified.\n\nSalivatypes and enterotypes revealed a greater proportion of pathobionts with concomitant reduction in autochthonous genera with increasing cirrhosis severity and hyperammonaemia. Increasing overlap between oral and gut microbiome communities was observed in DC and ACLF vs SC and HCs, independent of antimicrobial, beta-blocker and acid suppressant therapies. Two distinct gut microbiome clusters [ENT2/ENT3] harboured genes encoding for the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) system and other VFs in DC and ACLF. Substantial ARGs (oral: 1,218 and gut: 672) were detected [575 common to both sites]. The cirrhosis resistome was distinct, with three oral and four gut resistotypes identified, respectively.\n\nThe degree of oral-gut microbial community overlap, frequency of VFs and ARGs all increment significantly with cirrhosis severity, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. Despite similar antimicrobial exposure, patients with DC and ACLF have reduced microbial richness compared to NLS, supporting the additive pathobiological effect of cirrhosis.\n\nThis research underscores the crucial role of microbiome alterations in the progression of cirrhosis in an era of escalating multidrug resistant infections, highlighting the association and potential impact of increased oral-gut microbial overlap, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes on clinical outcomes. These findings are particularly significant for patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure, as they reveal the intricate relationship between microbiome alterations and cirrhosis complications. This is relevant in the context of multidrug-resistant organisms and reduced oral-gut microbial diversity that exacerbate cirrhosis severity, drive hepatic decompensation and complicate treatment. For practical applications, these insights could guide for cirrhosis patients the development of targeted microbiome-based therapeutics and personalised antimicrobial regimens to mitigate infectious complications to improve their clinical outcomes.",

    "title": "The high prevalence of antibiotic heteroresistance in pathogenic bacteria is mainly caused by gene amplification.",
    "abstract": "When choosing antibiotics to treat bacterial infections, it is assumed that the susceptibility of the target bacteria to an antibiotic is reflected by laboratory estimates of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to prevent bacterial growth. A caveat of using MIC data for this purpose is heteroresistance, the presence of a resistant subpopulation in a main population of susceptible cells. We investigated the prevalence and mechanisms of heteroresistance in 41 clinical isolates of the pathogens Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii against 28 different antibiotics. For the 766 bacteria-antibiotic combinations tested, as much as 27.4% of the total was heteroresistant. Genetic analysis demonstrated that a majority of heteroresistance cases were unstable, with an increased resistance of the subpopulations resulting from spontaneous tandem amplifications, typically including known resistance genes. Using mathematical modelling, we show how heteroresistance in the parameter range estimated in this study can result in the failure of antibiotic treatment of infections with bacteria that are classified as antibiotic susceptible. The high prevalence of heteroresistance with the potential for treatment failure highlights the limitations of MIC as the sole criterion for susceptibility determinations. These results call for the development of facile and rapid protocols to identify heteroresistance in pathogens.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing has potential to cure diseases without current treatments, but therapies must be safe. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 editing can introduce unintended mutations in vivo, which are passed on to the next generation. By editing fertilized zebrafish eggs using four guide RNAs selected for off-target activity in vitro, followed by long-read sequencing of DNA from >1100 larvae, juvenile and adult fish across two generations, we find that structural variants (SVs), i.e., insertions and deletions ≥50 bp, represent 6% of editing outcomes in founder larvae. These SVs occur both at on-target and off-target sites. Our results also illustrate that adult founder zebrafish are mosaic in their germ cells, and that 26% of their offspring carries an off-target mutation and 9% an SV. Hence, pre-testing for off-target activity and SVs using patient material is advisable in clinical applications, to reduce the risk of unanticipated effects with potentially large implications.",

    "title": "QS molecules change the planktonic/mineral subpopulations distribution of moderately thermophilic leaching bacteria in pyrite and decrease leaching in chalcopyrite.",
    "abstract": "Biomining is a sustainable alternative to conventional mineral processing that uses acidophilic microorganisms to catalyze the extraction of valuable metals from sulfide minerals. Mixed microbial consortia composed of moderate thermophiles such as Sulfobacillus and some Leptospirillum species improve metal extraction efficiency at higher temperatures compared to pure cultures of mesophiles. However, quorum sensing (QS), which regulates microbial interactions and likely influences bioleaching performance, has not been studied in these species. In this study, treatment of a moderately thermophilic biomining consortium with QS compounds, termed diffusible signal factors (DSF), reduced pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution via an inhibitory effect on iron oxidation and mineral colonization by the mixed culture. Furthermore, QS molecules changed the distribution of planktonic/mineral subpopulations of the acidophilic species. In addition, DSF compounds induced Acidithiobacillus caldus motility and dispersion from pyrite with a concomitant expansion of Leptospirillum ferriphilum on the mineral surface while in contrast, the acyl-homoserine lactone mediated QS system repressed L. ferriphilum motility. Moreover, the addition of QS molecules induced a second response related to the detrimental effect of high concentrations of fatty acids on cells, with an activation of detoxification mechanisms. Overall, QS regulated key target microbial interactions that opens the possibility to improve chalcopyrite bioleaching in the studied consortia.",

    "title": "Determining indicator taxa across spatial and seasonal gradients in the Columbia River coastal margin.",
    "abstract": "Bacterioplankton communities are deeply diverse and highly variable across space and time, but several recent studies demonstrate repeatable and predictable patterns in this diversity. We expanded on previous studies by determining patterns of variability in both individual taxa and bacterial communities across coastal environmental gradients. We surveyed bacterioplankton diversity across the Columbia River coastal margin, USA, using amplicon pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from 596 water samples collected from 2007 to 2010. Our results showed seasonal shifts and annual reassembly of bacterioplankton communities in the freshwater-influenced Columbia River, estuary, and plume, and identified indicator taxa, including species from freshwater SAR11, Oceanospirillales, and Flavobacteria groups, that characterize the changing seasonal conditions in these environments. In the river and estuary, Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria indicator taxa correlated strongly with seasonal fluctuations in particulate organic carbon (ρ=-0.664) and residence time (ρ=0.512), respectively. In contrast, seasonal change in communities was not detected in the coastal ocean and varied more with the spatial variability of environmental factors including temperature and dissolved oxygen. Indicator taxa of coastal ocean environments included SAR406 and SUP05 taxa from the deep ocean, and Prochlorococcus and SAR11 taxa from the upper water column. We found that in the Columbia River coastal margin, freshwater-influenced environments were consistent and predictable, whereas coastal ocean community variability was difficult to interpret due to complex physical conditions. This study moves beyond beta-diversity patterns to focus on the occurrence of specific taxa and lends insight into the potential ecological roles these taxa have in coastal ocean environments.",

    "title": "Human AdV-20-42-42, a Promising Novel Adenoviral Vector for Gene Therapy and Vaccine Product Development.",
    "abstract": "Preexisting immune responses toward adenoviral vectors limit the use of a vector based on particular serotypes and its clinical applicability for gene therapy and/or vaccination. Therefore, there is a significant interest in vectorizing novel adenoviral types that have low seroprevalence in the human population. Here, we describe the discovery and vectorization of a chimeric human adenovirus, which we call HAdV-20-42-42. Full-genome sequencing revealed that this virus is closely related to human serotype 42, except for the penton base, which is derived from serotype 20. The HAdV-20-42-42 vector could be propagated stably to high titers on existing E1-complementing packaging cell lines. Receptor-binding studies revealed that the vector utilized both CAR and CD46 as receptors for cell entry. Furthermore, the HAdV-20-42-42 vector was potent in transducing human and murine cardiovascular cells and tissues, irrespective of the presence of blood coagulation factor X. In vivo characterizations demonstrate that when delivered intravenously (i.v.) in mice, HAdV-20-42-42 mainly targeted the lungs, liver, and spleen and triggered robust inflammatory immune responses. Finally, we demonstrate that potent T-cell responses against vector-delivered antigens could be induced upon intramuscular vaccination in mice. In summary, from the data obtained we conclude that HAdV-20-42-42 provides a valuable addition to the portfolio of adenoviral vectors available to develop efficacious products in the fields of gene therapy and vaccination. IMPORTANCE Adenoviral vectors are under investigation for a broad range of therapeutic indications in diverse fields, such as oncology and gene therapy, as well as for vaccination both for human and veterinary use. A wealth of data shows that preexisting immune responses may limit the use of a vector. Particularly in the current climate of global pandemic, there is a need to expand the toolbox with novel adenoviral vectors for vaccine development. Our data demonstrate that we have successfully vectorized a novel adenovirus type candidate with low seroprevalence. The cell transduction data and antigen-specific immune responses induced in vivo demonstrate that this vector is highly promising for the development of gene therapy and vaccine products.",

    "title": "DNA-Metabarcoding of Belowground Fungal Communities in Bare-Root Forest Nurseries: Focus on Different Tree Species.",
    "abstract": "The production of tree seedlings in forest nurseries and their use in the replanting of clear-cut forest sites is a common practice in the temperate and boreal forests of Europe. Although conifers dominate on replanted sites, in recent years, deciduous tree species have received more attention due to their often-higher resilience to abiotic and biotic stress factors. The aim of the present study was to assess the belowground fungal communities of bare-root cultivated seedlings of Alnus glutinosa , Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Quercus robur in order to gain a better understanding of the associated fungi and oomycetes, and their potential effects on the seedling performance in forest nurseries and after outplanting. The study sites were at the seven largest bare-root forest nurseries in Lithuania. The sampling included the roots and adjacent soil of 2-3 year old healthy-looking seedlings. Following the isolation of the DNA from the individual root and soil samples, these were amplified using ITS rRNA as a marker, and subjected to high-throughput PacBio sequencing. The results showed the presence of 161,302 high-quality sequences, representing 2003 fungal and oomycete taxa. The most common fungi were Malassezia restricta (6.7% of all of the high-quality sequences), Wilcoxina mikolae (5.0%), Pustularia sp. 3993_4 (4.6%), and Fusarium oxysporum (3.5%). The most common oomycetes were Pythium ultimum var. ultimum (0.6%), Pythium heterothallicum (0.3%), Pythium spiculum (0.3%), and Pythium sylvaticum (0.2%). The coniferous tree species (P. abies and P. sylvestris) generally showed a higher richness of fungal taxa and a rather distinct fungal community composition compared to the deciduous tree species (A. glutinosa, B. pendula , and Q. robur). The results demonstrated that the seedling roots and the rhizosphere soil in forest nurseries support a high richness of fungal taxa. The seedling roots were primarily inhabited by saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, while fungal pathogens and oomycetes were less abundant, showing that the cultivation practices used in forest nurseries secured both the production of high-quality planting stock and disease control.",

    "title": "Long-read metabarcoding of the eukaryotic rDNA operon to phylogenetically and taxonomically resolve environmental diversity",
    "abstract": "High-throughput DNA metabarcoding of amplicon sizes below 500 bp has revolutionized the analysis of environmental microbial diversity. However, these short regions contain limited phylogenetic signal, which makes it impractical to use environmental DNA in full phylogenetic inferences. This lesser phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons may be overcome by new long-read sequencing technologies. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain an ~4500-bp region spanning most of the eukaryotic small subunit (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal DNA genes. We first treated the CCS reads with a novel curation workflow, generating 650 high-quality operational taxonomic units (OTUs) containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions. To assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based methods. The taxonomically annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing us to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1,019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58%) corresponded to the new long environmental OTUs. The long reads also allowed us to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny. Together, our results show that long amplicons can be treated in a full phylogenetic framework to provide greater taxonomic resolution and a robust evolutionary perspective to environmental DNA.",

    "title": "Viromics Reveal a Number of Novel RNA Viruses in Swedish Mosquitoes.",
    "abstract": "Metagenomic studies of mosquitoes have revealed that their virome is far more diverse and includes many more viruses than just the pathogenic arboviruses vectored by mosquitoes. In this study, the virome of 953 female mosquitoes collected in the summer of 2017, representing six mosquito species from two geographic locations in Mid-Eastern Sweden, were characterized. In addition, the near-complete genome of nine RNA viruses were characterized and phylogenetically analysed. These viruses showed association to the viral orders Bunyavirales, Picornavirales, Articulavirales, and Tymovirales, and to the realm Ribovira. Hence, through this study, we expand the knowledge of the virome composition of different mosquito species in Sweden. In addition, by providing viral reference genomes from wider geographic regions and different mosquito species, future in silico recognition and assembly of viral genomes in metagenomic datasets will be facilitated.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary Spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are heterogeneous group of degenerative disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs, combined with additional neurological features. This study aimed to identify causative gene variants in two nonrelated consanguineous Pakistani families segregating HSP. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on a total of five individuals from two families including four affected and one phenotypically normal individual. The variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis. In family A, a novel homozygous variant c.604G > A (p.Glu202Lys) was identified in the CYP2U1 gene with clinical symptoms of SPG56 in 3 siblings. Whereas, a previously reported variant c.5769delT (p.Ser1923Argfs*28) in the SPG11 gene was identified in family B manifesting clinical features of SPG11 in 3 affected individuals. Our combined findings add to the clinical and genetic variability associated with CYP2U1 and SPG11 variants highlighting the complexity of HSPs. These findings further emphasize the usefulness of WES as a powerful diagnostic tool.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a well-known cause of postpartum infections and is causing significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nTo describe measures taken to control an outbreak of postpartum infections caused by S. pyogenes emm75 on a maternity ward.\n\nPatients presenting postpartum with signs and symptoms of infection were cultured for β-haemolytic streptococci with cervical swabs and blood cultures, and bacterial isolates were species-determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and emm-typed. Pharyngeal swabs were taken from healthcare workers (HCWs) at the ward. Bacterial isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The multi-locus sequence type and the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to an index genome were determined.\n\nDuring a three-month period, six cases of postpartum infection with S. pyogenes emm75 were identified on the maternity ward. By comparing delivery dates with duty rotas, one HCW was identified as a possible source of infection in five cases. After repeated pharyngeal swabs from this individual, an S. pyogenes emm75 was isolated. The five isolates from patients epidemiologically linked to the HCW and the two isolates of the family members had an identical sequence type (ST49) and 0-2 SNPs difference compared to the HCW isolate, whereas the sixth patient had an unrelated isolate. Eradication antibiotic therapy with clindamycin and rifampicin was given to the carrier. All patients received intravenous antibiotic treatment and recovered.\n\nA three-month outbreak was stopped when a carrier was identified and treated. Source identification and WGS proved vital for outbreak control.",

    "title": "A chromosome-level assembly of the Atlantic herring genome-detection of a supergene and other signals of selection.",
    "abstract": "The Atlantic herring is a model species for exploring the genetic basis for ecological adaptation, due to its huge population size and extremely low genetic differentiation at selectively neutral loci. However, such studies have so far been hampered because of a highly fragmented genome assembly. Here, we deliver a chromosome-level genome assembly based on a hybrid approach combining a de novo Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) assembly with Hi-C-supported scaffolding. The assembly comprises 26 autosomes with sizes ranging from 12.4 to 33.1 Mb and a total size, in chromosomes, of 726 Mb, which has been corroborated by a high-resolution linkage map. A comparison between the herring genome assembly with other high-quality assemblies from bony fishes revealed few inter-chromosomal but frequent intra-chromosomal rearrangements. The improved assembly facilitates analysis of previously intractable large-scale structural variation, allowing, for example, the detection of a 7.8-Mb inversion on Chromosome 12 underlying ecological adaptation. This supergene shows strong genetic differentiation between populations. The chromosome-based assembly also markedly improves the interpretation of previously detected signals of selection, allowing us to reveal hundreds of independent loci associated with ecological adaptation.",

    "title": "Higher host plant specialization of root-associated endophytes than mycorrhizal fungi along an arctic elevational gradient.",
    "abstract": "How community-level specialization differs among groups of organisms, and changes along environmental gradients, is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms influencing ecological communities. In this paper, we investigate the specialization of root-associated fungi for plant species, asking whether the level of specialization varies with elevation. For this, we applied DNA barcoding based on the ITS region to root samples of five plant species equivalently sampled along an elevational gradient at a high arctic site. To assess whether the level of specialization changed with elevation and whether the observed patterns varied between mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi, we applied a joint species distribution modeling approach. Our results show that host plant specialization is not environmentally constrained in arctic root-associated fungal communities, since there was no evidence for changing specialization with elevation, even if the composition of root-associated fungal communities changed substantially. However, the level of specialization for particular plant species differed among fungal groups, root-associated endophytic fungal communities being highly specialized on particular host species, and mycorrhizal fungi showing almost no signs of specialization. Our results suggest that plant identity affects associated mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi differently, highlighting the need of considering both endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi when studying specialization in root-associated fungal communities.",

    "abstract": "The PI3K pathway is a major driver of cancer progression. However, clinical resistance to PI3K inhibition is common. IBL-302 is a novel highly specific triple PIM, PI3K, and mTOR inhibitor. Screening IBL-302 in over 700 cell lines representing 47 tumor types identified neuroblastoma as a strong candidate for PIM/PI3K/mTOR inhibition. IBL-302 was more effective than single PI3K inhibition in vitro, and IBL-302 treatment of neuroblastoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells induced apoptosis, differentiated tumor cells, and decreased N-Myc protein levels. IBL-302 further enhanced the effect of the common cytotoxic chemotherapies cisplatin, doxorubicin, and etoposide. Global genome, proteome, and phospho-proteome analyses identified crucial biological processes, including cell motility and apoptosis, targeted by IBL-302 treatment. While IBL-302 treatment alone reduced tumor growth in vivo, combination therapy with low-dose cisplatin inhibited neuroblastoma PDX growth. Complementing conventional chemotherapy treatment with PIM/PI3K/mTOR inhibition has the potential to improve clinical outcomes and reduce severe late effects in children with high-risk neuroblastoma.",

    "title": "RNA Sequencing Reveals the Long Non-Coding RNA Signature in Psoriasis Keratinocytes and Identifies CYDAER as a Long Non-Coding RNA Regulating Epidermal Differentiation.",
    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease determined by genetic and environmental factors, resulting in the activation of IL-23/IL-17-mediated immune response, epidermal hyperproliferation, and keratinocyte activation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts > 500 nucleotides with diverse regulatory functions; their role in epidermal dysfunction in psoriasis is poorly understood. To identify epidermal transcripts with potential roles in psoriasis, including lncRNAs, we performed RNA sequencing on keratinocytes from psoriasis and healthy skin. We identified 889 differentially expressed lncRNAs, many of which with yet unknown functions. RP11-295G20.2 was identified as a lncRNA significantly induced in psoriasis keratinocytes, and this was verified by qRT-PCR and by single-molecule in situ hybridisation. Analysis of subcellular fractions of epidermis revealed a cytoplasmic localisation in line with results of single molecule in situ hybridisation. We report that RP11-295G20.2 has a skin-enriched expression, and within skin it is mainly expressed in suprabasal epidermal layers. Moreover, RP11-295G20.2 is induced by the key psoriasis cytokine IL-17A and shows a dynamic regulation during keratinocyte differentiation with upregulation during early differentiation and downregulation in the late stage. Knockdown of RP11-295G20.2 in keratinocytes promotes terminal differentiation. Based on our findings, we named RP11-295G20.2 Cytoplasmic Differentiation-Associated Epidermal RNA, CYDAER. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive characterisation of the non-coding RNA landscape of psoriasis keratinocytes and identifies CYDAER as a skin-enriched lncRNA regulating keratinocyte differentiation. Our data suggest that overexpression of CYDAER may contribute to altered differentiation in psoriatic epidermis.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) can adapt naturally to survive Varroa destructor, the primary cause of colony mortality world-wide. Most of the adaptive traits of naturally varroa-surviving honeybees concern varroa reproduction. Here we investigate whether factors in the honeybee metagenome also contribute to this survival. The quantitative and qualitative composition of the bacterial and viral metagenome fluctuated greatly during the active season, but with little overall difference between varroa-surviving and varroa-susceptible colonies. The main exceptions were Bartonella apis and sacbrood virus, particularly during early spring and autumn. Bombella apis was also strongly associated with early and late season, though equally for all colonies. All three affect colony protein management and metabolism. Lake Sinai virus was more abundant in varroa-surviving colonies during the summer. Lake Sinai virus and deformed wing virus also showed a tendency towards seasonal genetic change, but without any distinction between varroa-surviving and varroa-susceptible colonies. Whether the changes in these taxa contribute to survival or reflect demographic differences between the colonies (or both) remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Non-Helicobacter pylori microbiota might account for some cases with unexplained chronic gastritis that may in a minority eventually progress to gastric cancer through the Correa cascade. We characterized gastric microbiota by describing the normal stomach, compared it with early precancerous lesions and other disease states, and assessed whether H. pylori status affects bacterial diversity.\n\nIn a population-based study of those with and without gastrointestinal symptoms, cytology brush samples were collected during endoscopy from 316 individuals. Mucosal status was classified as normal mucosa (171), nonatrophic H. pylori gastritis (33), atrophic gastritis (12), or antral chemical gastritis (61). The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis were performed to characterize the microbiota.\n\nMicrobiota in atrophic gastritis and nonatrophic H. pylori gastritis stomachs were dysbiotic and differed from those in the normal stomach (P = 0.001). The normal stomach had the highest microbial diversity, followed by antral chemical gastritis. The atrophic gastritis and chronic H. pylori gastritis groups had the lowest diversity, a difference that was statistically significant (P = 0.01). Besides H. pylori, non-H. pylori bacteria accounted for group differences. Microbial network analysis showed that the normal group network was most highly connected, whereas the H. pylori gastritis group had the lowest connection. We found an increasing positive co-occurrence of oral bacteria in the stomach because samples deviated from the normal network, some of which were pathogens. The H. pylori-negative group had the highest microbial diversity (Shannon index) compared with the H. pylori-positive group (P = 0.001).\n\nIn this low-H. pylori prevalence general population, the gastric mucosal microbiota of the normal stomach differed significantly from those with nonatrophic or atrophic gastritis. There was an increasing abundance of pathogenic bacteria from the normal state to early precancerous states.",

    "abstract": "Halophytophthora species have been traditionally regarded as brackish water oomycetes; however, recent reports in inland freshwater call for a better understanding of their ecology and possible pathogenicity. We studied the distribution of Halophytophthora fluviatilis in 117 forest streams by metabarcoding river filtrates taken in spring and autumn and by direct isolation from floating leaves. Pathogenicity on six Fagaceae species and Alnus glutinosa was assessed by stem inoculations. The distribution of H. fluviatilis was correlated with high mean annual temperatures (>93.5% of reports in Ta > 12.2 °C) and low precipitation records. H. fluviatilis was therefore widely distributed in forest streams in a warm-dry climate, but it was mostly absent in subalpine streams. H. fluviatilis was primarily detected in autumn with few findings in spring (28.4% vs. 2.7% of streams). H. fluviatilis was able to cause small lesions on some tree species such as Quercus pubescens, Q. suber and A. glutinosa. Our findings suggest that H. fluviatilis may be adapted to warm and dry conditions, and that it does not pose a significant threat to the most common Mediterranean broadleaved trees.",

    "abstract": "Viruses in aquatic environments play a key role in microbial population dynamics and nutrient cycling. In particular, bacteria of the phylum Bacteriodetes are known to participate in recycling algal blooms. Studies of phage-host interactions involving this phylum are hence important to understand the processes shaping bacterial and viral communities in the ocean as well as nutrient cycling. In this study, we isolated and sequenced three strains of flavobacteria-LMO6, LMO9, LMO8-and 38 virulent phages infecting them. These phages represent 15 species, occupying three novel genera. Additionally, one temperate phage was induced from LMO6 and was found to be competent at infecting LMO9. Functions could be predicted for a limited number of phage genes, mainly representing roles in DNA replication and virus particle formation. No metabolic genes were detected. While the phages isolated on LMO8 could infect all three bacterial strains, the LMO6 and LMO9 phages could not infect LMO8. Of the phages isolated on LMO9, several showed a host-derived reduced efficiency of plating on LMO6, potentially due to differences in DNA methyltransferase genes. Overall, these phage-host systems contribute novel genetic information to our sequence databases and present valuable tools for the study of both virulent and temperate phages.",

    "title": "Mast Cell Phenotypic Heterogeneity Impacts the Interplay with Pathogenic Salmonella Typhimurium Bacteria.",
    "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) lodge within barrier tissues and respond to infectious microbes. Recent work demonstrated that MCs differentiate their cytokine response to extracellular versus invasive Gram-negative enterobacteria by a two-step activation mechanism that integrates Toll-like-receptor (TLR) sensing with signals elicited by type-III-secretion-system (TTSS) effectors during bacterial invasion. However, multiple MC subtypes exist, and it remains unclear how their phenotypic heterogeneity impacts microbial interactions. We find that murine MCs maintained in IL-3, or differentiated toward a connective-tissue phenotype (CT-MCs), respond potently to the enteropathogen Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (S.Tm) through two-step activation, with the TLR component explained by functional TLR4 and TLR2. By contrast, murine mucosal mast cells (M-MCs) express insignificant levels of these TLRs, therefore being unresponsive to extracellular S.Tm, but still mounting a response to invasive bacteria. Following invasion, MC granule maintenance by serglycin restricts S.Tm vacuolar and cytosolic colonization. Notably, this has no impact on the cytokine release from infected MCs, thus uncoupling S.Tm´s intracellular life-cycle from the MC cytokine response. Finally, human LUVA MCs employ a variant of two-step activation where TLR2/6 signaling combines with the TTSS-elicited signals. Together, this study explains how MC subtypes can respond differently to S.Tm-infection depending on their TLR expression and granule features.",

    "title": "Global genome splicing analysis reveals an increased number of alternatively spliced genes with aging.",
    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism for the development of different tissues; however, not much is known about changes to alternative splicing during aging. Splicing events may become more frequent and widespread genome-wide as tissues age and the splicing machinery stringency decreases. Using skin, skeletal muscle, bone, thymus, and white adipose tissue from wild-type C57BL6/J male mice (4 and 18 months old), we examined the effect of age on splicing by AS analysis of the differential exon usage of the genome. The results identified a considerable number of AS genes in skeletal muscle, thymus, bone, and white adipose tissue between the different age groups (ranging from 27 to 246 AS genes corresponding to 0.3-3.2% of the total number of genes analyzed). For skin, skeletal muscle, and bone, we included a later age group (28 months old) that showed that the number of alternatively spliced genes increased with age in all three tissues (P < 0.01). Analysis of alternatively spliced genes across all tissues by gene ontology and pathway analysis identified 158 genes involved in RNA processing. Additional analysis of AS in a mouse model for the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome was performed. The results show that expression of the mutant protein, progerin, is associated with an impaired developmental splicing. As progerin accumulates, the number of genes with AS increases compared to in wild-type skin. Our results indicate the existence of a mechanism for increased AS during aging in several tissues, emphasizing that AS has a more important role in the aging process than previously known.",

    "title": "Dominance of Mating Type A1 and Indication of Epigenetic Effects During Early Stages of Mating in Phytophthora infestans.",
    "abstract": "The potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans has both an asexual and a sexual mode of reproduction. In Scandinavia, the pathogen is reproducing sexually on a regular basis, whereas clonal lineages dominate in other geographical regions. This study aimed at elucidating events or key genes underlying this difference in sexual behavior. First, the transcriptomes of eight strains, known as either clonal or sexual, were compared during early stages of mating. Principal component analysis (PCA) divided the samples in two clusters A and B and a clear grouping of the mating samples together with the A1 mating type parents was observed. Induction of genes encoding DNA adenine N6-methylation (6mA) methyl-transferases clearly showed a bias toward the cluster A. In contrast, the Avrblb2 effector gene family was highly induced in most of the mating samples and was associated with cluster B in the PCA, similarly to genes coding for acetyl-transferases, which play an important role in RXLR modification prior to secretion. Avrblb2 knock-down strains displayed a reduction in virulence and oospore formation, suggesting a role during the mating process. In conclusion, a number of gene candidates important for the reproductive processes were revealed. The results suggest a possible epigenetic influence and involvement of specific RXLR effectors in mating-related processes.",

    "abstract": "To date, single-cell studies of human white adipose tissue (WAT) have been based on small cohort sizes and no cellular consensus nomenclature exists. Herein, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of publicly available and newly generated single-cell, single-nucleus, and spatial transcriptomic results from human subcutaneous, omental, and perivascular WAT. Our high-resolution map is built on data from ten studies and allowed us to robustly identify >60 subpopulations of adipocytes, fibroblast and adipogenic progenitors, vascular, and immune cells. Using these results, we deconvolved spatial and bulk transcriptomic data from nine additional cohorts to provide spatial and clinical dimensions to the map. This identified cell-cell interactions as well as relationships between specific cell subtypes and insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, adipocyte volume, and lipolysis upon long-term weight changes. Altogether, our meta-map provides a rich resource defining the cellular and microarchitectural landscape of human WAT and describes the associations between specific cell types and metabolic states.",

    "abstract": "Long-read single molecule sequencing is increasingly used in human genomics research, as it allows to accurately detect large-scale DNA rearrangements such as structural variations (SVs) at high resolution. However, few studies have evaluated the performance of different single molecule sequencing platforms for SV detection in human samples. Here we performed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) whole-genome sequencing of two Swedish human samples (average 32× coverage) and compared the results to previously generated Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) data for the same individuals (average 66× coverage). Our analysis inferred an average of 17k and 23k SVs from the ONT and PacBio data, respectively, with a majority of them overlapping with an available multi-platform SV dataset. When comparing the SV calls in the two Swedish individuals, we find a higher concordance between ONT and PacBio SVs detected in the same individual as compared to SVs detected by the same technology in different individuals. Downsampling of PacBio reads, performed to obtain similar coverage levels for all datasets, resulted in 17k SVs per individual and improved overlap with the ONT SVs. Our results suggest that ONT and PacBio have a similar performance for SV detection in human whole genome sequencing data, and that both technologies are feasible for population-scale studies.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain cancer with a poor prognosis for affected patients. The current line of treatment only gives the patients a survival time of on average 15 months. In this work, we use genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) together with other systems biology tools to examine the global transcriptomics-data of GBM-patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying GBM and identify potential therapeutic targets for effective treatment of patients. The work presented consists of two main parts. The first part stratifies the patients into two groups, high and low survival, and compares their gene expression. The second part uses GBM and healthy brain tissue GEMs to simulate gene knockout in a GBM cell model to find potential therapeutic targets and predict their side effect in healthy brain tissue. We (1) find that genes upregulated in the patients with low survival are linked to various stages of the glioma invasion process, and (2) identify five essential genes for GBM, whose inhibition is non-toxic to healthy brain tissue, therefore promising to investigate further as therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Effects of whole-grain wheat, rye, and lignan supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors in men with metabolic syndrome: a randomized crossover trial.",
    "abstract": "A whole-grain (WG)-rich diet has shown to have potential for both prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is a cluster of risk factors that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Different WGs may have different health effects. WG rye, in particular, may improve glucose homeostasis and blood lipids, possibly mediated through fermentable dietary fiber and lignans. Recent studies have also suggested a crucial role of the gut microbiota in response to WG.\n\nThe aim was to investigate WG rye, alone and with lignan supplements [secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG)], and WG wheat diets on glucose tolerance [oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT)], other cardiometabolic outcomes, enterolignans, and microbiota composition. Moreover, we exploratively evaluated the role of gut microbiota enterotypes in response to intervention diets.\n\nForty men with MetS risk profile were randomly assigned to WG diets in an 8-wk crossover study. The rye diet was supplemented with 280 mg SDG at weeks 4-8. Effects of treatment were evaluated by mixed-effects modeling, and effects on microbiota composition and the role of gut microbiota as a predictor of response to treatment were analyzed by random forest plots.\n\nThe WG rye diet (± SDG supplements) did not affect the OGTT compared with WG wheat. Total and LDL cholesterol were lowered (-0.06 and -0.09 mmol/L, respectively; P < 0.05) after WG rye compared with WG wheat after 4 wk but not after 8 wk. WG rye resulted in higher abundance of Bifidobacterium [fold-change (FC) = 2.58, P < 0.001] compared with baseline and lower abundance of Clostridium genus compared with WG wheat (FC = 0.54, P = 0.02). The explorative analyses suggest that baseline enterotype is associated with total and LDL-cholesterol response to diet.\n\nWG rye, alone or with SDG supplementation, compared with WG wheat did not affect glucose metabolism but caused transient LDL-cholesterol reduction. The effect of WG diets appeared to differ according to enterotype. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02987595.",

    "title": "Evolutionary History of the Marchantia polymorpha Complex.",
    "abstract": "The potential role of introgression in evolution has gained increased interest in recent years. Although some fascinating examples have been reported, more information is needed to generalize the importance of hybridization and introgression for adaptive divergence. As limited data exist on haploid dominant species, we analyzed genomes of three subspecies of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. We used available genomic data for subsp. ruderalis and carried out whole-genome (PacBio) sequencing for one individual each of subsp. montivagans and subsp. polymorpha as well as Illumina resequencing of additional genomes for all three subspecies. The three subspecies were compared against M. paleacea as outgroup. Our analyses revealed separation of the three taxa, but all three possible topologies were richly represented across the genomes, and the underlying divergence order less obvious. This uncertainty could be the result of the divergence of the three subspecies close in time, or that introgression has been frequent since divergence. In particular, we found that pseudo-chromosome 2 in subsp. montivagans was much more diverged than other parts of the genomes. This could either be explained by specific capture of chromosome 2 from an unknown related species through hybridization or by conservation of chromosome 2 despite intermittent or ongoing introgression affecting more permeable parts of the genomes. A higher degree of chromosomal rearrangements on pseudo-chromosome 2 support the second hypothesis. Species tree analyses recovered an overall topology where subsp. montivagans diverged first and subsp. ruderalis and subsp. polymorpha appeared as sister lineages. Each subspecies was associated with its own chloroplast and mitochondrial haplotype group. Our data suggest introgression but refute a previous hypothesis that subsp. ruderalis is a new stabilized hybrid between the other two subspecies.",

    "abstract": "The human uterus includes the complex endometrial mucosa, the endometrium that undergoes dynamic, hormone-dependent alterations throughout the life of fertile females. Here we have combined a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis with immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to analyze gene expression patterns in the normal endometrium. Human endometrial tissues from five women were used for deep sequencing (RNA-Seq). The mRNA and protein expression data from the endometrium were compared to 31 (RNA) and 44 (protein) other normal tissue types, to identify genes with elevated expression in the endometrium and to localize the expression of corresponding proteins at a cellular resolution. Based on the expression levels of transcripts, we could classify all putative human protein coding genes into categories defined by expression patterns and found altogether 101 genes that showed an elevated pattern of expression in the endometrium, with only four genes showing more than five-fold higher expression levels in the endometrium compared to other tissues. In conclusion, our analysis based on transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling reports here comprehensive lists of genes with elevated expression levels in the endometrium, providing important starting points for a better molecular understanding of human reproductive biology and disease.",

While the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ProQ harbors the major RNA-binding activity, the role of the ProQ C-terminal domain (CTD) has remained unclear. Here, we have applied saturation mutagenesis coupled to phenotypic sorting and long-read sequencing to chart the regulatory capacity of Salmonella ProQ. Parallel monitoring of thousands of ProQ mutants allowed mapping of critical residues in both the NTD and the CTD, while the linker separating these domains was tolerant to mutations. Single amino acid substitutions in the NTD associated with abolished regulatory capacity strongly align with RNA-binding deficiency. An observed cellular instability of ProQ associated with mutations in the NTD suggests that interaction with RNA protects ProQ from degradation. Mutation of conserved CTD residues led to overstabilization of RNA targets and rendered ProQ inert in regulation, without affecting protein stability in vivo. Furthermore, ProQ lacking the CTD, although binding competent, failed to protect an mRNA target from degradation. Together, our data provide a comprehensive overview of residues important for ProQ-dependent regulation and reveal an essential role for the enigmatic ProQ CTD in gene regulation.",

    "title": "Reindeer control over subarctic treeline alters soil fungal communities with potential consequences for soil carbon storage.",
    "abstract": "The climate-driven encroachment of shrubs into the Arctic is accompanied by shifts in soil fungal communities that could contribute to a net release of carbon from tundra soils. At the same time, arctic grazers are known to prevent the establishment of deciduous shrubs and, under certain conditions, promote the dominance of evergreen shrubs. As these different vegetation types associate with contrasting fungal communities, the belowground consequences of climate change could vary among grazing regimes. Yet, at present, the impact of grazing on soil fungal communities and their links to soil carbon have remained speculative. Here we tested how soil fungal community composition, diversity and function depend on tree vicinity and long-term reindeer grazing regime and assessed how the fungal communities relate to organic soil carbon stocks in an alpine treeline ecotone in Northern Scandinavia. We determined soil carbon stocks and characterized soil fungal communities directly underneath and >3 m away from mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) in two adjacent 55-year-old grazing regimes with or without summer grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We show that the area exposed to year-round grazing dominated by evergreen dwarf shrubs had higher soil C:N ratio, higher fungal abundance and lower fungal diversity compared with the area with only winter grazing and higher abundance of mountain birch. Although soil carbon stocks did not differ between the grazing regimes, stocks were positively associated with root-associated ascomycetes, typical to the year-round grazing regime, and negatively associated with free-living saprotrophs, typical to the winter grazing regime. These findings suggest that when grazers promote dominance of evergreen dwarf shrubs, they induce shifts in soil fungal communities that increase soil carbon sequestration in the long term. Thus, to predict climate-driven changes in soil carbon, grazer-induced shifts in vegetation and soil fungal communities need to be accounted for.",

    "title": "Genetically Determined Inflammation-Related Proteins in Asthma and Type-2 Signatures.",
    "abstract": "Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) remain underexplored in asthma but might provide valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate associations between genetic variation and inflammation-related plasma proteins and to assess differences in the levels of genetically determined proteins in subjects with signatures of type-2 inflammation and/or asthma.\n\nA pQTL mapping of 92 inflammation-related plasma proteins was conducted in young adults from the Swedish BAMSE cohort (n = 1538). Replication of sentinel pQTLs was attempted, and the overlap and colocalization of pQTLs with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were investigated using publicly available data. Proteins with significant pQTLs were tested for association with type-2 signatures defined as high levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophils, and/or sensitization to airborne allergens in subjects with or without asthma in BAMSE.\n\nForty-five sentinel pQTLs (33 cis, 12 trans) for 39 inflammation-related proteins were identified (p ≤ 7.14 × 10-11), and a high proportion of these were validated in independent populations. A high likelihood for colocalization of cis-pQTLs and cis-eQTLs was observed for 19 proteins in different tissues. Six of the 39 circulating proteins with significant pQTLs were associated with type-2 signatures and/or asthma, and matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10) showed the most significant associations.\n\nThese findings underscore the existence of a genetic component influencing the plasma levels of proteins involved in inflammatory processes, including MMP-10, which is suggested to have a role in high type-2 inflammation in asthma subjects.",

We found total of 4,284 viral reads, out of which 4,168 were Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-related, belonging to 15 known (HPV8, HPV12, HPV20, HPV36, HPV38, HPV45, HPV57, HPV59, HPV104, HPV105, HPV107, HPV109, HPV124, HPV138, HPV147), four previously described putative (HPV 915 F 06 007 FD1, FA73, FA101, SE42) and two putatively new HPV types (SE46, SE47). SE42 was cloned, sequenced, designated as HPV155 and found to have 76% similarity to the most closely related known HPV type. In conclusion, an unbiased approach for viral DNA detection in skin tumors has found that, although some new putative HPVs were found, known HPV types constituted most of the viral DNA.",

    "title": "The POU/Oct Transcription Factor Pdm1/nub Is Necessary for a Beneficial Gut Microbiota and Normal Lifespan of Drosophila.",
    "abstract": "Maintenance of a stable gut microbial community relies on a delicate balance between immune defense and immune tolerance. We have used Drosophila to study how the microbial gut flora is affected by changes in host genetic factors and immunity. Flies with a constitutively active gut immune system, due to a mutation in the POU transcriptional regulator Pdm1/nubbin (nub) gene, had higher loads of bacteria and a more diverse taxonomic composition than controls. In addition, the microbial composition shifted considerably during the short lifespan of the nub1 mutants. This shift was characterized by a loss of relatively few OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and a remarkable increase in a large number of Acetobacter spp. and Leuconostoc spp. Treating nub1 mutant flies with antibiotics prolonged their lifetime survival by more than 100%. Immune gene expression was also persistently high in the presence of antibiotics, indicating that the early death was not a direct consequence of an overactive immune defense but rather an indirect consequence of the microbial load and composition. Thus, changes in host genotype and an inability to regulate the normal growth and composition of the gut microbiota leads to a shift in the microbial community, dysbiosis and early death.",

    "title": "Phylogenetic history of patrilineages rare in northern and eastern Europe from large-scale re-sequencing of human Y-chromosomes.",
    "abstract": "The most frequent Y-chromosomal (chrY) haplogroups in northern and eastern Europe (NEE) are well-known and thoroughly characterised. Yet a considerable number of men in every population carry rare paternal lineages with estimated frequencies around 5%. So far, limited sample-sizes and insufficient resolution of genotyping have obstructed a truly comprehensive look into the variety of rare paternal lineages segregating within populations and potential signals of population history that such lineages might convey. Here we harness the power of massive re-sequencing of human Y chromosomes to identify previously unknown population-specific clusters among rare paternal lineages in NEE. We construct dated phylogenies for haplogroups E2-M215, J2-M172, G-M201 and Q-M242 on the basis of 421 (of them 282 novel) high-coverage chrY sequences collected from large-scale databases focusing on populations of NEE. Within these otherwise rare haplogroups we disclose lineages that began to radiate ~1-3 thousand years ago in Estonia and Sweden and reveal male phylogenetic patterns testifying of comparatively recent local demographic expansions. Conversely, haplogroup Q lineages bear evidence of ancient Siberian influence lingering in the modern paternal gene pool of northern Europe. We assess the possible direction of influx of ancestral carriers for some of these male lineages. In addition, we demonstrate the congruency of paternal haplogroup composition of our dataset with two independent population-based cohorts from Estonia and Sweden.",

    "title": "A genome sequence resource for the genus Passiflora, the genome of the wild diploid species Passiflora organensis.",
    "abstract": "The genus Passiflora comprises a large group of plants popularly known as passionfruit, much appreciated for their exotic flowers and edible fruits. The species (∼500) are morphologically variable (e.g., growth habit, size, and color of flowers) and are adapted to distinct tropical ecosystems. In this study, we generated the genome of the wild diploid species Passiflora organensis Gardner by adopting a hybrid assembly approach. Passiflora organensis has a small genome of 259 Mbp and a heterozygosity rate of 81%, consistent with its reproductive system. Most of the genome sequences could be integrated into its chromosomes with cytogenomic markers (satellite DNA) as references. The repeated sequences accounted for 58.55% of the total DNA analyzed, and the Tekay lineage was the prevalent retrotransposon. In total, 25,327 coding genes were predicted. Passiflora organensis retains 5,609 singletons and 15,671 gene families. We focused on the genes potentially involved in the locus determining self-incompatibility and the MADS-box gene family, allowing us to infer expansions and contractions within specific subfamilies. Finally, we recovered the organellar DNA. Structural rearrangements and two mitoviruses, besides relics of other mobile elements, were found in the chloroplast and mt-DNA molecules, respectively. This study presents the first draft genome assembly of a wild Passiflora species, providing a valuable sequence resource for genomic and evolutionary studies on the genus, and support for breeding cropped passionfruit species.",

    "title": "Gene-specific correlation of RNA and protein levels in human cells and tissues.",
    "abstract": "An important issue for molecular biology is to establish whether transcript levels of a given gene can be used as proxies for the corresponding protein levels. Here, we have developed a targeted proteomics approach for a set of human non-secreted proteins based on parallel reaction monitoring to measure, at steady-state conditions, absolute protein copy numbers across human tissues and cell lines and compared these levels with the corresponding mRNA levels using transcriptomics. The study shows that the transcript and protein levels do not correlate well unless a gene-specific RNA-to-protein (RTP) conversion factor independent of the tissue type is introduced, thus significantly enhancing the predictability of protein copy numbers from RNA levels. The results show that the RTP ratio varies significantly with a few hundred copies per mRNA molecule for some genes to several hundred thousands of protein copies per mRNA molecule for others. In conclusion, our data suggest that transcriptome analysis can be used as a tool to predict the protein copy numbers per cell, thus forming an attractive link between the field of genomics and proteomics.",

    "title": "Association study of PDE4B gene variants in Scandinavian schizophrenia and bipolar disorder multicenter case-control samples.",
    "abstract": "The phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which is involved in cognitive function in animal models, is a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). Variations in PDE4B have previously been associated with SZ, with a suggested gender-specific effect. We have genotyped and analyzed 40 and 72 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in SZ and BP multicenter samples, respectively, from the Scandinavian Collaboration on Psychiatric Etiology (SCOPE), involving 837 SZ cases and 1,473 controls plus 594 BP cases and 1,421 partly overlapping controls. Six and 16 tagSNPs were nominally associated (0.0005 < or = P < or = 0.05) with SZ and BP, respectively, in the combined samples or in gender-specific subgroups. None of these findings remained significant after correction for multiple testing. However, a number of tagSNPs found to be nominally associated with SZ and BP were located in a high LD region spanning the splice site of PDE4B3, an isoform with altered brain expression in BP patients. Four tagSNPs were associated with SZ in women, but none in men, in agreement with the previously reported gender-specific effect. Proxies of two nominally associated SNPs in the SZ sample were also associated with BP, but the genotypic effect (i.e., homozygosity for the minor allele), pointed in opposite directions. Finally, four SNPs were found to be associated with Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive symptom scores in a subgroup of SZ patients (n = 153) or SZ female patients (n = 70). Further studies are needed to evaluate the implicated PDE4B region of interest, for potential involvement in SZ and BP susceptibility.",
