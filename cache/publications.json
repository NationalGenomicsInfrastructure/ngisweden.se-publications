    "title": "Replacement of two amino acids of 9R-dioxygenase-allene oxide synthase of Aspergillus niger inverts the chirality of the hydroperoxide and the allene oxide.",
    "abstract": "The genome of Aspergillus niger codes for a fusion protein (EHA25900), which can be aligned with ~50% sequence identity to 9S-dioxygenase (DOX)-allene oxide synthase (AOS) of Fusarium oxysporum, homologues of the Fusarium and Colletotrichum complexes and with over 62% sequence identity to homologues of Aspergilli, including (DOX)-9R-AOS of Aspergillus terreus. The aims were to characterize the enzymatic activities of EHA25900 and to identify crucial amino acids for the stereospecificity. Recombinant EHA25900 oxidized 18:2n-6 sequentially to 9R-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9R-HPODE) and to a 9R(10)-allene oxide. 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS catalyze abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen at C-11, but the direction of oxygen insertion differs. A comparison between twelve 9-DOX domains of 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS revealed conserved amino acid differences, which could contribute to the chirality of products. The Gly616Ile replacement of 9R-DOX-AOS (A. niger) increased the biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide, whereas the Phe627Leu replacement led to biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide as main products. The double mutant (Gly616Ile, Phe627Leu) formed over 90% of the 9S stereoisomer of HPODE. 9S-HPODE was formed by antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion, i.e., the original H-abstraction was retained but the product chirality was altered. We conclude that 9R-DOX-AOS can be altered to 9S-DOX-AOS by replacement of two amino acids (Gly616Ile, Phe627Leu) in the DOX domain.",

    "title": "Genome-wide association study of angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker treatment.",
    "abstract": "Angioedema in the mouth or upper airways is a feared adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatment, which is used for hypertension, heart failure and diabetes complications. This candidate gene and genome-wide association study aimed to identify genetic variants predisposing to angioedema induced by these drugs. The discovery cohort consisted of 173 cases and 4890 controls recruited in Sweden. In the candidate gene analysis, ETV6, BDKRB2, MME, and PRKCQ were nominally associated with angioedema (p < 0.05), but did not pass Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p < 2.89 × 10-5). In the genome-wide analysis, intronic variants in the calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1 (KCNMA1) gene on chromosome 10 were significantly associated with angioedema (p < 5 × 10-8). Whilst the top KCNMA1 hit was not significant in the replication cohort (413 cases and 599 ACEi-exposed controls from the US and Northern Europe), a meta-analysis of the replication and discovery cohorts (in total 586 cases and 1944 ACEi-exposed controls) revealed that each variant allele increased the odds of experiencing angioedema 1.62 times (95% confidence interval 1.05-2.50, p = 0.030). Associated KCNMA1 variants are not known to be functional, but are in linkage disequilibrium with variants in transcription factor binding sites active in relevant tissues. In summary, our data suggest that common variation in KCNMA1 is associated with risk of angioedema induced by ACEi or ARB treatment. Future whole exome or genome sequencing studies will show whether rare variants in KCNMA1 or other genes contribute to the risk of ACEi- and ARB-induced angioedema.",

    "title": "The genetic consequences of dog breed formation-Accumulation of deleterious genetic variation and fixation of mutations associated with myxomatous mitral valve disease in cavalier King Charles spaniels.",
    "abstract": "Selective breeding for desirable traits in strictly controlled populations has generated an extraordinary diversity in canine morphology and behaviour, but has also led to loss of genetic variation and random entrapment of disease alleles. As a consequence, specific diseases are now prevalent in certain breeds, but whether the recent breeding practice led to an overall increase in genetic load remains unclear. Here we generate whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 20 dogs per breed from eight breeds and document a ~10% rise in the number of derived alleles per genome at evolutionarily conserved sites in the heavily bottlenecked cavalier King Charles spaniel breed (cKCs) relative to in most breeds studied here. Our finding represents the first clear indication of a relative increase in levels of deleterious genetic variation in a specific breed, arguing that recent breeding practices probably were associated with an accumulation of genetic load in dogs. We then use the WGS data to identify candidate risk alleles for the most common cause for veterinary care in cKCs-the heart disease myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). We verify a potential link to MMVD for candidate variants near the heart specific NEBL gene in a dachshund population and show that two of the NEBL candidate variants have regulatory potential in heart-derived cell lines and are associated with reduced NEBL isoform nebulette expression in papillary muscle (but not in mitral valve, nor in left ventricular wall). Alleles linked to reduced nebulette expression may hence predispose cKCs and other breeds to MMVD via loss of papillary muscle integrity.",

    "title": "FGFR1 overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer is mediated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and is a determinant of FGFR1 inhibitor response.",
    "abstract": "Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been considered as an actionable drug target. However, pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not demonstrate convincing clinical efficacy in FGFR1-amplified NSCLC patients. This study aimed to characterise the molecular context of FGFR1 expression and to define biomarkers predictive of FGFR1 inhibitor response. In this study, 635 NSCLC samples were characterised for FGFR1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry and copy number gain (CNG) by in situ hybridisation (n = 298) or DNA microarray (n = 189). FGFR1 gene expression (n = 369) and immune cell profiles (n = 309) were also examined. Furthermore, gene expression, methylation and microRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were compared. A panel of FGFR1-amplified NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were tested for response to the selective FGFR1 antagonist M6123. A minority of patients demonstrated FGFR1 CNG (10.5%) or increased FGFR1 mRNA (8.7%) and protein expression (4.4%). FGFR1 CNG correlated weakly with FGFR1 gene and protein expression. Tumours overexpressing FGFR1 protein were typically devoid of driver alterations (e.g. EGFR, KRAS) and showed reduced infiltration of T-lymphocytes and lower PD-L1 expression. Promoter methylation and microRNA were identified as regulators of FGFR1 expression in NSCLC and other cancers. Finally, NSCLC PDX models demonstrating FGFR1 amplification and FGFR1 protein overexpression were sensitive to M6123. The unique molecular and immune features of tumours with high FGFR1 expression provide a rationale to stratify patients in future clinical trials of FGFR1 pathway-targeting agents.",

    "title": "Characterization of Dynamic Regulatory Gene and Protein Networks in Wheat Roots Upon Perceiving Water Deficit Through Comparative Transcriptomics Survey.",
    "abstract": "A well-developed root system benefits host plants by optimizing water absorption and nutrient uptake and thereby increases plant productivity. In this study we have characterized the root transcriptome using RNA-seq and subsequential functional analysis in a set of drought tolerant and susceptible genotypes. The goal of the study was to elucidate and characterize water deficit-responsive genes in wheat landraces that had been through long-term field and biochemical screening for drought tolerance. The results confirm genotype differences in water-deficit tolerance in line with earlier results from field trials. The transcriptomics survey highlighted a total of 14,187 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that responded to water deficit. The characterization of these genes shows that all chromosomes contribute to water-deficit tolerance, but to different degrees, and the B genome showed higher involvement than the A and D genomes. The DEGs were mainly mapped to flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, and diterpenoid biosynthesis pathways, as well as glutathione metabolism and hormone signaling. Furthermore, extracellular region, apoplast, cell periphery, and external encapsulating structure were the main water deficit-responsive cellular components in roots. A total of 1,377 DEGs were also predicted to function as transcription factors (TFs) from different families regulating downstream cascades. TFs from the AP2/ERF-ERF, MYB-related, B3, WRKY, Tify, and NAC families were the main genotype-specific regulatory factors. To further characterize the dynamic biosynthetic pathways, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using significant KEGG proteins and putative TFs. In PPIs, enzymes from the CYP450, TaABA8OH2, PAL, and GST families play important roles in water-deficit tolerance in connection with MYB13-1, MADS-box, and NAC transcription factors.",

    "title": "Comparative analyses of the Hymenoscyphus fraxineus and Hymenoscyphus albidus genomes reveals potentially adaptive differences in secondary metabolite and transposable element repertoires.",
    "abstract": "The dieback epidemic decimating common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in Europe is caused by the invasive fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. In this study we analyzed the genomes of H. fraxineus and H. albidus, its native but, now essentially displaced, non-pathogenic sister species, and compared them with several other members of Helotiales. The focus of the analyses was to identify signals in the genome that may explain the rapid establishment of H. fraxineus and displacement of H. albidus.\n\nThe genomes of H. fraxineus and H. albidus showed a high level of synteny and identity. The assembly of H. fraxineus is 13 Mb longer than that of H. albidus', most of this difference can be attributed to higher dispersed repeat content (i.e. transposable elements [TEs]) in H. fraxineus. In general, TE families in H. fraxineus showed more signals of repeat-induced point mutations (RIP) than in H. albidus, especially in Long-terminal repeat (LTR)/Copia and LTR/Gypsy elements. Comparing gene family expansions and 1:1 orthologs, relatively few genes show signs of positive selection between species. However, several of those did appeared to be associated with secondary metabolite genes families, including gene families containing two of the genes in the H. fraxineus-specific, hymenosetin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC).\n\nThe genomes of H. fraxineus and H. albidus show a high degree of synteny, and are rich in both TEs and BGCs, but the genomic signatures also indicated that H. albidus may be less well equipped to adapt and maintain its ecological niche in a rapidly changing environment.",

The extensive phenotypic diversity among extant isolated populations makes the species a great insular model system for eco-evolutionary studies, as well as a challenging target for conservation management plans. Here we report the first high-quality chromosome-level assembly and annotation of the P. lilfordi genome, along with its mitogenome, based on a mixed sequencing strategy (10X Genomics linked reads, Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads and Hi-C scaffolding) coupled with extensive transcriptomic data (Illumina and PacBio). The genome assembly (1.5 Gb) is highly contiguous (N50 = 90 Mb) and complete, with 99% of the sequence assigned to candidate chromosomal sequences and >97% gene completeness. We annotated a total of 25,663 protein-coding genes translating into 38,615 proteins. Comparison to the genome of the related species Podarcis muralis revealed substantial similarity in genome size, annotation metrics, repeat content, and a strong collinearity, despite their evolutionary distance (~18-20 MYA). This genome expands the repertoire of available reptilian genomes and will facilitate the exploration of the molecular and evolutionary processes underlying the extraordinary phenotypic diversity of this insular species, while providing a critical resource for conservation genomics.",

    "title": "Somatic Exonic Deletions in RUNX1 Constitutes a Novel Recurrent Genomic Abnormality in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.",
    "abstract": "In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), somatic mutations (commonly missense, nonsense, and frameshift indels) in RUNX1 are associated with a dismal clinical outcome. Inherited RUNX1 mutations cause familial platelet disorder. As approximately 5%-10% of germline RUNX1 mutations are large exonic deletions, we hypothesized that such exonic RUNX1 aberrations may also be acquired during the development of AML.\n\nSixty patients with well-characterized AML were analyzed with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (n = 60), microarray (n = 11), and/or whole-genome sequencing (n = 8).\n\nIn total, 25 (42% of the cohort) RUNX1-aberrant patients (defined by the presence of classical mutations and/or exonic deletions) were identified. Sixteen patients (27%) carried only exonic deletions, 5 (8%) carried classical mutations, and 4 (7%) carried both exonic deletions and mutations. No significant difference was observed between patients with classical RUNX1 mutations and RUNX1 exonic deletions in median overall survival (OS, 53.1 vs. 38.8 months, respectively, P = 0.63). When applying the European Leukemia Net (ELN) classification including the RUNX1-aberrant group, 20% of the patients initially stratified as intermediate-risk (5% of the whole cohort) were reassigned to the high-risk group, which improved the performance of ELN classification regarding OS between intermediate- and high-risk groups (18.9 vs. 9.6 months, P = 0.09).\n\nSomatic RUNX1 exonic deletions constitute a novel recurrent aberration in AML. Our findings have important clinical implications regarding AML classification, risk stratification, and treatment decision. Moreover, they argue in favor of further investigating such genomic aberrations not only in RUNX1 but also in other genes implicated in cancer biology and management.

    "abstract": "Despite compelling evidence that cigarette smoking impacts the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), little is known about smoking-associated changes in the primary exposed lung cells of patients.\n\nWe aimed to examine molecular changes occurring in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from MS patients in relation to smoking and in comparison to healthy controls (HCs).\n\nWe profiled DNA methylation in BAL cells from female MS (n = 17) and HC (n = 22) individuals, using Illumina Infinium EPIC and performed RNA-sequencing in non-smokers.\n\nThe most prominent changes were found in relation to smoking, with 1376 CpG sites (adjusted P < 0.05) differing between MS smokers and non-smokers. Approximately 30% of the affected genes overlapped with smoking-associated changes in HC, leading to a strong common smoking signature in both MS and HC after gene ontology analysis. Smoking in MS patients resulted in additional discrete changes related to neuronal processes. Methylome and transcriptome analyses in non-smokers suggest that BAL cells from MS patients display very subtle (not reaching adjusted P < 0.05) but concordant changes in genes connected to reduced transcriptional/translational processes and enhanced cellular motility.\n\nOur study provides insights into the impact of smoking on lung inflammation and immunopathogenesis of MS.",

    "title": "Hybrid sequencing resolves two germline ultra-complex chromosomal rearrangements consisting of 137 breakpoint junctions in a single carrier.",
    "abstract": "Chromoanagenesis is a genomic event responsible for the formation of complex structural chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs). Germline chromoanagenesis is rare and the majority of reported cases are associated with an affected phenotype. Here, we report a healthy female carrying two de novo CCRs involving chromosomes 4, 19, 21 and X and chromosomes 7 and 11, respectively, with a total of 137 breakpoint junctions (BPJs). We characterized the CCRs using a hybrid-sequencing approach, combining short-read sequencing, nanopore sequencing, and optical mapping. The results were validated using multiple cytogenetic methods, including fluorescence in situ hybridization, spectral karyotyping, and Sanger sequencing. We identified 137 BPJs, which to our knowledge is the highest number of reported breakpoint junctions in germline chromoanagenesis. We also performed a statistical assessment of the positioning of the breakpoints, revealing a significant enrichment of BPJ-affecting genes (96 intragenic BPJs, 26 genes, p < 0.0001), indicating that the CCRs formed during active transcription of these genes. In addition, we find that the DNA fragments are unevenly and non-randomly distributed across the derivative chromosomes indicating a multistep process of scattering and re-joining of DNA fragments. In summary, we report a new maximum number of BPJs (137) in germline chromoanagenesis. We also show that a hybrid sequencing approach is necessary for the correct characterization of complex CCRs. Through in-depth statistical assessment, it was found that the CCRs most likely was formed through an event resembling chromoplexy-a catastrophic event caused by erroneous transcription factor binding.",

    "title": "African and Asian leopards are highly differentiated at the genomic level.",
    "abstract": "Leopards are the only big cats still widely distributed across the continents of Africa and Asia. They occur in a wide range of habitats and are often found in close proximity to humans. But despite their ubiquity, leopard phylogeography and population history have not yet been studied with genomic tools. Here, we present population-genomic data from 26 modern and historical samples encompassing the vast geographical distribution of this species. We find that Asian leopards are broadly monophyletic with respect to African leopards across almost their entire nuclear genomes. This profound genetic pattern persists despite the animals' high potential mobility, and despite evidence of transfer of African alleles into Middle Eastern and Central Asian leopard populations within the last 100,000 years. Our results further suggest that Asian leopards originated from a single out-of-Africa dispersal event 500-600 thousand years ago and are characterized by higher population structuring, stronger isolation by distance, and lower heterozygosity than African leopards. Taxonomic categories do not take into account the variability in depth of divergence among subspecies. The deep divergence between the African subspecies and Asian populations contrasts with the much shallower divergence among putative Asian subspecies. Reconciling genomic variation and taxonomy is likely to be a growing challenge in the genomics era.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major cancer types in the western world including Sweden. However, known genetic risk factors could only explain a limited part of heritability of the disease. Moreover, colon and rectal cancers are habitually discussed as one entity, colorectal cancer, although different carcinogenesis has been recognized. A genome-wide linkage scan in 32 colon- and 56 rectal cancer families from Sweden was performed based on 475 non-FAP/HNPCC patients genotyped using SNP arrays. A maximum HLOD of 2.50 at locus 6p21.1-p12.1 and a HLOD of 2.56 at 18p11.2 was obtained for colon and rectal cancer families, respectively. Exome sequencing over the regions of interest in 12 patients from six families identified 22 and 25 candidate risk variants for colon and rectal cancer, respectively. Haplotype association analysis in the two regions was carried out between additional 477 familial CRC cases and 4780 controls and suggested candidate haplotypes possibly associated with CRC risk. This study suggested two new linkage regions for colon cancer and rectal cancer with candidate predisposing variants. Further studies are required to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these regions and to pinpoint the causative genes.",

    "title": "Adaptive Introgression Facilitates Adaptation to High Latitudes in European Aspen (Populus tremula L.).",
    "abstract": "Understanding local adaptation has become a key research area given the ongoing climate challenge and the concomitant requirement to conserve genetic resources. Perennial plants, such as forest trees, are good models to study local adaptation given their wide geographic distribution, largely outcrossing mating systems, and demographic histories. We evaluated signatures of local adaptation in European aspen (Populus tremula) across Europe by means of whole-genome resequencing of a collection of 411 individual trees. We dissected admixture patterns between aspen lineages and observed a strong genomic mosaicism in Scandinavian trees, evidencing different colonization trajectories into the peninsula from Russia, Central and Western Europe. As a consequence of the secondary contacts between populations after the last glacial maximum, we detected an adaptive introgression event in a genome region of ∼500 kb in chromosome 10, harboring a large-effect locus that has previously been shown to contribute to adaptation to the short growing seasons characteristic of Northern Scandinavia. Demographic simulations and ancestry inference suggest an Eastern origin-probably Russian-of the adaptive Nordic allele which nowadays is present in a homozygous state at the north of Scandinavia. The strength of introgression and positive selection signatures in this region is a unique feature in the genome. Furthermore, we detected signals of balancing selection, shared across regional populations, that highlight the importance of standing variation as a primary source of alleles that facilitate local adaptation. Our results, therefore, emphasize the importance of migration-selection balance underlying the genetic architecture of key adaptive quantitative traits.",

Deletion of the obligate PRC2 component, Eed, in these neurons resulted in global loss of H3K27me3, followed by a gradual activation of genes harboring both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 modifications. Notably, H3K9me3 was lost at these PRC2 targets before gene activation. Neuronal survival was not compromised; instead, there was a reduction in subtype-specific gene expression and a progressive impairment of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal function, leading to behavioral deficits characteristic of Parkinson's disease and anxiety. Single-cell analysis revealed subtype-specific vulnerability to loss of PRC2 repression in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra. Our study reveals that a PRC2-dependent nonpermissive chromatin state is essential to maintain the subtype identity and function of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Herbicide pollution poses a worldwide threat to plants and freshwater ecosystems. However, the understanding of how organisms develop tolerance to these chemicals and the associated trade-off expenses are largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the physiological and transcriptional mechanisms underlying the acclimation of the green microalgal model species Raphidocelis subcapitata (Selenastraceae) towards the herbicide diflufenican, and the fitness costs associated with tolerance development. Algae were exposed for 12 weeks (corresponding to 100 generations) to diflufenican at the two environmental concentrations 10 and 310 ng/L. The monitoring of growth, pigment composition, and photosynthetic performance throughout the experiment revealed an initial dose-dependent stress phase (week 1) with an EC50 of 397 ng/L, followed by a time-dependent recovery phase during weeks 2 to 4. After week 4, R. subcapitata was acclimated to diflufenican exposure with a similar growth rate, content of carotenoids, and photosynthetic performance as the unexposed control algae. This acclimation state of the algae was explored in terms of tolerance acquisition, changes in the fatty acids composition, diflufenican removal rate, cell size, and changes in mRNA gene expression profile, revealing potential fitness costs associated with acclimation, such as up-regulation of genes related to cell division, structure, morphology, and reduction of cell size. Overall, this study demonstrates that R. subcapitata can quickly acclimate to environmental but toxic levels of diflufenican; however, the acclimation is associated with trade-off expenses that result in smaller cell size.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of plant circadian clock evolution have often relied on clock models and genes defined in Arabidopsis. These studies identified homologues with seemingly conserved function, as well as frequent gene loss. In the present study, we aimed to identify candidate clock genes in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha using a more unbiased approach. To identify genes with circadian rhythm we sequenced the transcriptomes of gemmalings in a time series in constant light conditions. Subsequently, we performed functional studies using loss-of-function mutants and gene expression reporters. Among the genes displaying circadian rhythm, a homologue to the transcriptional co-repressor Arabidopsis DE-ETIOLATED1 showed high amplitude and morning phase. Because AtDET1 is arrhythmic and associated with the morning gene function of AtCCA1/LHY, that lack a homologue in liverworts, we functionally studied DET1 in M. polymorpha. We found that the circadian rhythm of MpDET1 expression is disrupted in loss-of-function mutants of core clock genes and putative evening-complex genes. MpDET1 knock-down in turn results in altered circadian rhythm of nyctinastic thallus movement and clock gene expression. We could not detect any effect of MpDET1 knock-down on circadian response to light, suggesting that MpDET1 has a yet unknown function in the M. polymorpha circadian clock.",

    "abstract": "Insects have been key players in the assessments of biodiversity impacts of anthropogenically driven environmental change, including the evolutionary and ecological impacts of climate change. Populations of Edith's Checkerspot Butterfly (Euphydryas editha) adapt rapidly to diverse environmental conditions, with numerous high-impact studies documenting these dynamics over several decades. However, studies of the underlying genetic bases of these responses have been hampered by missing genomic resources, limiting the ability to connect genomic responses to environmental change. Using a combination of Oxford Nanopore long reads, haplotype merging, HiC scaffolding followed by Illumina polishing, we generated a highly contiguous and complete assembly (contigs n = 142, N50 = 21.2 Mb, total length = 607.8 Mb; BUSCOs n = 5,286, single copy complete = 97.8%, duplicated = 0.9%, fragmented = 0.3%, missing = 1.0%). A total of 98% of the assembled genome was placed into 31 chromosomes, which displayed large-scale synteny with other well-characterized lepidopteran genomes. The E. editha genome, annotation, and functional descriptions now fill a missing gap for one of the leading field-based ecological model systems in North America.",

    "title": "Common and mutation specific phenotypes of KRAS and BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer cells revealed by integrative -omics analysis.",
    "abstract": "Genes in the Ras pathway have somatic mutations in at least 60 % of colorectal cancers. Despite activating the same pathway, the BRAF V600E mutation and the prevalent mutations in codon 12 and 13 of KRAS have all been linked to different clinical outcomes, but the molecular mechanisms behind these differences largely remain to be clarified.\n\nTo characterize the similarities and differences between common activating KRAS mutations and between KRAS and BRAF mutations, we used genome editing to engineer KRAS G12C/D/V and G13D mutations in colorectal cancer cells that had their mutant BRAF V600E allele removed and subjected them to transcriptome sequencing, global proteomics and metabolomics analyses.\n\nBy intersecting differentially expressed genes, proteins and metabolites, we uncovered (i) two-fold more regulated genes and proteins when comparing KRAS to BRAF mutant cells to those lacking Ras pathway mutation, (ii) five differentially expressed proteins in KRAS mutants compared to cells lacking Ras pathway mutation (IFI16, S100A10, CD44, GLRX and AHNAK2) and 6 (CRABP2, FLNA, NXN, LCP1, S100A10 and S100A2) compared to BRAF mutant cells, (iii) 19 proteins expressed differentially in a KRAS mutation specific manner versus BRAF V600E cells, (iv) regulation of the Integrin Linked Kinase pathway by KRAS but not BRAF mutation, (v) regulation of amino acid metabolism, particularly of the tyrosine, histidine, arginine and proline pathways, the urea cycle and purine metabolism by Ras pathway mutations, (vi) increased free carnitine in KRAS and BRAF mutant RKO cells.\n\nThis comprehensive integrative -omics analysis confirms known and adds novel genes, proteins and metabolic pathways regulated by mutant KRAS and BRAF signaling in colorectal cancer. The results from the new model systems presented here can inform future development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches targeting tumors with KRAS and BRAF mutations.",

    "title": "Differential DNA Methylation of the Genes for Amyloid Precursor Protein, Tau, and Neurofilaments in Human Traumatic Brain Injury.",
    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an established risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders and dementias. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may alter the expression of genes without altering the DNA sequence in response to environmental factors. We hypothesized that DNA methylation changes may occur in the injured human brain and be implicated in the neurodegenerative aftermath of TBI. The DNA methylation status of genes related to neurodegeneration; for example, amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), neurofilament heavy (NEFH), neurofilament medium (NEFM), and neurofilament light (NEFL), was analyzed in fresh, surgically resected human brain tissue from 17 severe TBI patients and compared with brain biopsy samples from 19 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). We also performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) comparing TBI patients with iNPH controls. Thirty-eight CpG sites in the APP, MAPT, NEFH, and NEFL genes were differentially methylated by TBI. Among the top 20 differentially methylated CpG sites, 11 were in the APP gene. In addition, the EWAS evaluating 828,888 CpG sites revealed 308 differentially methylated CpG sites in genes related to cellular/anatomical structure development, cell differentiation, and anatomical morphogenesis. These preliminary findings provide the first evidence of an altered DNA methylome in the injured human brain, and may have implications for the neurodegenerative disorders associated with TBI.",

    "title": "Avian neo-sex chromosomes reveal dynamics of recombination suppression and W degeneration.",
    "abstract": "How the avian sex chromosomes first evolved from autosomes remains elusive as 100 million years (Myr) of divergence and degeneration obscure their evolutionary history. The Sylvioidea group of songbirds is interesting for understanding avian sex chromosome evolution because a chromosome fusion event ∼24 Myr ago formed \"neo-sex chromosomes\" consisting of an added (new) and an ancestral (old) part. Here, we report the complete female genome (ZW) of one Sylvioidea species, the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Our long-read assembly shows that the added region has been translocated to both Z and W, and while the added-Z has remained its gene order the added-W part has been heavily rearranged. Phylogenetic analyses show that recombination between the homologous added-Z and -W regions continued after the fusion event, and that recombination suppression across this region took several million years to be completed. Moreover, recombination suppression was initiated across multiple positions over the added-Z, which is not consistent with a simple linear progression starting from the fusion point. As expected following recombination suppression, the added-W show signs of degeneration including repeat accumulation and gene loss. Finally, we present evidence for non-random maintenance of slowly evolving and dosage-sensitive genes on both ancestral- and added-W, a process causing correlated evolution among orthologous genes across broad taxonomic groups, regardless of sex-linkage.",

Patients & methods: We performed genome-wide association studies in 198 RA patients starting MTX. Outcomes were maximum level of ALT and ALT >1.5-times the upper level of normal within the first 6 months of treatment. Results: RAVER2 (rs72675408) was significantly associated with maximum level of ALT (p = 4.36 × 10-8). This variant is in linkage disequilibrium with rs72675451, which is associated with differential expression of JAK1 and RAVER2. Conclusion: We found an association between ALT elevation and genetic variants that may regulate the expression of JAK1 and RAVER2. JAK1 encodes a janus kinase involved in the pathogenesis of RA.",

    "title": "Puma genomes from North and South America provide insights into the genomic consequences of inbreeding.",
    "abstract": "Pumas are the most widely distributed felid in the Western Hemisphere. Increasingly, however, human persecution and habitat loss are isolating puma populations. To explore the genomic consequences of this isolation, we assemble a draft puma genome and a geographically broad panel of resequenced individuals. We estimate that the lineage leading to present-day North American pumas diverged from South American lineages 300-100 thousand years ago. We find signatures of close inbreeding in geographically isolated North American populations, but also that tracts of homozygosity are rarely shared among these populations, suggesting that assisted gene flow would restore local genetic diversity. The genome of a Florida panther descended from translocated Central American individuals has long tracts of homozygosity despite recent outbreeding. This suggests that while translocations may introduce diversity, sustaining diversity in small and isolated populations will require either repeated translocations or restoration of landscape connectivity. Our approach provides a framework for genome-wide analyses that can be applied to the management of similarly small and isolated populations.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in structural subunits and assembly factors of complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation system constitute the most common cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defects. Such mutations can present a wide range of clinical manifestations, varying from mild deficiencies to severe, lethal disorders. We describe a patient presenting intrauterine growth restriction and anemia, which displayed postpartum hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, and a severe complex I defect with fatal outcome. Whole genome sequencing revealed an intronic biallelic mutation in the NDUFB7 gene (c.113-10C>G) and splicing pattern alterations in NDUFB7 messenger RNA were confirmed by RNA Sequencing. The detected variant resulted in a significant reduction of the NDUFB7 protein and reduced complex I activity. Complementation studies with expression of wild-type NDUFB7 in patient fibroblasts normalized complex I function. Here we report a case with a primary complex I defect due to a homozygous mutation in an intron region of the NDUFB7 gene.",

    "abstract": "The cell cycle, over which cells grow and divide, is a fundamental process of life. Its dysregulation has devastating consequences, including cancer1-3. The cell cycle is driven by precise regulation of proteins in time and space, which creates variability between individual proliferating cells. To our knowledge, no systematic investigations of such cell-to-cell proteomic variability exist. Here we present a comprehensive, spatiotemporal map of human proteomic heterogeneity by integrating proteomics at subcellular resolution with single-cell transcriptomics and precise temporal measurements of individual cells in the cell cycle. We show that around one-fifth of the human proteome displays cell-to-cell variability, identify hundreds of proteins with previously unknown associations with mitosis and the cell cycle, and provide evidence that several of these proteins have oncogenic functions. Our results show that cell cycle progression explains less than half of all cell-to-cell variability, and that most cycling proteins are regulated post-translationally, rather than by transcriptomic cycling. These proteins are disproportionately phosphorylated by kinases that regulate cell fate, whereas non-cycling proteins that vary between cells are more likely to be modified by kinases that regulate metabolism. This spatially resolved proteomic map of the cell cycle is integrated into the Human Protein Atlas and will serve as a resource for accelerating molecular studies of the human cell cycle and cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain remains a significant medical challenge with complex underlying mechanisms, and an urgent need for new treatments. Our research built and utilized the iPain single-cell atlas to study chronic pain progression in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. We discovered that senescence of a small subset of pain-sensing neurons may be a driver of chronic pain. This mechanism was observed in animal models after nerve injury and in human patients diagnosed with chronic pain or diabetic painful neuropathy. Notably, treatment with senolytics, drugs that remove senescent cells, reversed pain symptoms in mice post-injury. These findings highlight the role of cellular senescence in chronic pain development, demonstrate the therapeutic potential of senolytic treatments, and underscore the value of the iPain atlas for future pain research.",

    "title": "Stage-specific transposon activity in the life cycle of the fairy-ring mushroom <i>Marasmius oreades</i>.",
    "abstract": "Genetic variability can be generated by different mechanisms, and across the life cycle. Many basidiomycete fungi have an extended somatic stage, during which each cell carries two genetically distinct haploid nuclei (dikaryosis), resulting from fusion of two compatible monokaryotic individuals. Recent findings have revealed remarkable genome stability at the nucleotide level during dikaryotic growth in these organisms, but whether this pattern extends to mutations affecting large genomic regions remains unknown. Furthermore, despite high genome integrity during dikaryosis, basidiomycete populations are not devoid of genetic diversity, begging the question of when this diversity is introduced. Here, we used a <i>Marasmius oreades</i> fairy ring to investigate the rise of large-scale variants during mono- and dikaryosis. By separating the two nuclear genotypes from four fruiting bodies and generating complete genome assemblies, we gained access to investigate genomic changes of any size. We found that during dikaryotic growth in nature the genome stayed intact, but after separating the nucleotypes into monokaryons, a considerable amount of structural variation started to accumulate, driven to large extent by transposons. Transposon insertions were also found in monokaryotic single-meiospore isolates. Hence, we show that genome integrity in basidiomycetes can be interrupted during monokaryosis, leading to genomic rearrangements and increased activity of transposable elements. We suggest that genetic diversification is disproportionate between life cycle stages in mushroom-forming fungi, so that the short-lived monokaryotic growth stage is more prone to genetic changes than the dikaryotic stage.",

    "title": "Pregnancy-related hormones and COMT genotype: Associations with maternal working memory.",
    "abstract": "Women experience different degrees of subjective cognitive changes during pregnancy. The exact mechanism underlying these changes is unknown, although endocrine alterations and genetics may be contributing factors. We investigated whether multiple pregnancy-related hormones were associated with working memory function assessed with the Digit Span Test (DST) in late pregnancy. Moreover, we examined whether the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype, previously related to working memory, was an effect modifier in this association. In this population-based panel study, we recorded psychiatric history, medication use, socio-demographic characteristics, and psychological well-being, gathered blood and saliva samples, and administered the DST at gestational weeks 35-39 (N = 216). We conducted multivariate linear regressions with DST as outcome, with different hormones and COMT genotype, adjusting for covariates including maternal age, BMI, education, depressive symptoms, and parity. We repeated these analyses excluding women with elevated depressive symptoms. Higher DST total scores were associated with increased free estradiol concentrations (B = 0.01, p = 0.03; B = 0.01, p = 0.02) in all participants and in participants without depressive symptoms, respectively, whereas DST forward was positively associated with free estradiol only in women without depressive symptoms (B = 0.01, p = 0.04). Lower total testosterone concentrations (B = -0.03, p = 0.01) enhanced DST backward performance in non-depressed women. Maternal higher education was significantly associated with the DST subscales in all participants. No significant differences emerged when considering the COMT genotype. Our results suggest differential associations of free estradiol and total testosterone levels with working memory function in late pregnancy.",

    "title": "Extensive Clonal Branching Shapes the Evolutionary History of High-Risk Pediatric Cancers.",
    "abstract": "Darwinian evolution of tumor cells remains underexplored in childhood cancer. We here reconstruct the evolutionary histories of 56 pediatric primary tumors, including 24 neuroblastomas, 24 Wilms tumors, and 8 rhabdomyosarcomas. Whole-genome copy-number and whole-exome mutational profiling of multiple regions per tumor were performed, followed by clonal deconvolution to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree for each tumor. Overall, 88% of the tumors exhibited genetic variation among primary tumor regions. This variability typically emerged through collateral phylogenetic branching, leading to spatial variability in the distribution of more than 50% (96/173) of detected diagnostically informative genetic aberrations. Single-cell sequencing of 547 individual cancer cells from eight solid pediatric tumors confirmed branching evolution to be a fundamental underlying principle of genetic variation in all cases. Strikingly, cell-to-cell genetic diversity was almost twice as high in aggressive compared with clinically favorable tumors (median Simpson index of diversity 0.45 vs. 0.88; P = 0.029). Similarly, a comparison of multiregional sampling data from a total of 274 tumor regions showed that new phylogenetic branches emerge at a higher frequency per sample and carry a higher mutational load in high-risk than in low-risk tumors. Timelines based on spatial genetic variation showed that the mutations most influencing relapse risk occur at initiation of clonal expansion in neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, whereas in Wilms tumor, they are late events. Thus, from an evolutionary standpoint, some high-risk childhood cancers are born bad, whereas others grow worse over time. SIGNIFICANCE: Different pediatric cancers with a high risk of relapse share a common generic pattern of extensively branching evolution of somatic mutations.

    "title": "Chromoanagenesis Event Underlies a de novo Pericentric and Multiple Paracentric Inversions in a Single Chromosome Causing Coffin-Siris Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Chromoanagenesis is a descriptive term that encompasses classes of catastrophic mutagenic processes that generate localized and complex chromosome rearrangements in both somatic and germline genomes. Herein, we describe a 5-year-old female presenting with a constellation of clinical features consistent with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris syndrome 1 (CSS1). Initial G-banded karyotyping detected a 90-Mb pericentric and a 47-Mb paracentric inversion on a single chromosome. Subsequent analysis of short-read whole-genome sequencing data and genomic optical mapping revealed additional inversions, all clustered on chromosome 6, one of them disrupting ARID1B for which haploinsufficiency leads to the CSS1 disease trait (MIM:135900). The aggregate structural variant data show that the resolved, the resolved derivative chromosome architecture presents four de novo inversions, one pericentric and three paracentric, involving six breakpoint junctions in what appears to be a shuffling of genomic material on this chromosome. Each junction was resolved to nucleotide-level resolution with mutational signatures suggestive of non-homologous end joining. The disruption of the gene ARID1B is shown to occur between the fourth and fifth exon of the canonical transcript with subsequent qPCR studies confirming a decrease in ARID1B expression in the patient versus healthy controls. Deciphering the underlying genomic architecture of chromosomal rearrangements and complex structural variants may require multiple technologies and can be critical to elucidating the molecular etiology of a patient's clinical phenotype or resolving unsolved Mendelian disease cases.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain cancer with a poor prognosis for affected patients. The current line of treatment only gives the patients a survival time of on average 15 months. In this work, we use genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) together with other systems biology tools to examine the global transcriptomics-data of GBM-patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying GBM and identify potential therapeutic targets for effective treatment of patients. The work presented consists of two main parts. The first part stratifies the patients into two groups, high and low survival, and compares their gene expression. The second part uses GBM and healthy brain tissue GEMs to simulate gene knockout in a GBM cell model to find potential therapeutic targets and predict their side effect in healthy brain tissue. We (1) find that genes upregulated in the patients with low survival are linked to various stages of the glioma invasion process, and (2) identify five essential genes for GBM, whose inhibition is non-toxic to healthy brain tissue, therefore promising to investigate further as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Angioedema is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse reaction associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Identification of potential genetic factors related to this adverse event may help identify at-risk patients.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to identify genetic factors associated with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.\r\n\r\nA genomewide association study involving patients of European descent, all taking ACE inhibitors, was conducted in a discovery cohort (Copenhagen Hospital Biobank), and associations were confirmed in a replication cohort (Swedegene). Cases were defined as subjects with angioedema events and filled prescriptions for ACE inhibitors ≤180 days before the events. Control subjects were defined as those with continuous treatment with ACE inhibitors without any history of angioedema. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for angioedema risk using logistic mixed model regression analysis. Summary statistics from the discovery and replication cohorts were analyzed using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model.\r\n\r\nThe discovery cohort consisted of 462 cases and 53,391 ACE inhibitor-treated control subjects. The replication cohort consisted of 142 cases and 1,345 ACE inhibitor-treated control subjects. In the discovery cohort, 1 locus, residing at chromosome 14q32.2, was identified that associated with angioedema at the genomewide significance level of P <5 × 10-8. The lead variant at this locus, rs34485356, is an intergenic variant located 60 kb upstream of BDKRB2 (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.38 to 1.90; P = 4.3 × 10-9). This variant was validated in our replication cohort with a similar direction and effect size (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.25; P = 7.2 × 10-3). We found that carriers of the risk allele had significantly lower systolic (-0.46 mm Hg per T allele; 95% CI: -0.83 to -0.10; P = 0.013) and diastolic (-0.26 mm Hg per T allele; 95% CI: -0.46 to -0.05; P = 0.013) blood pressure.\r\n\r\nIn this genomewide association study involving individuals treated with ACE inhibitors, we found that common variants located in close proximity to the bradykinin receptor B2 gene were associated with increased risk for ACE inhibitor-related angioedema.",

    "abstract": "The precise pattern and timing of speciation events that gave rise to all living placental mammals remain controversial. We provide a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of genetic variation across an alignment of 241 placental mammal genome assemblies, addressing prior concerns regarding limited genomic sampling across species. We compared neutral genome-wide phylogenomic signals using concatenation and coalescent-based approaches, interrogated phylogenetic variation across chromosomes, and analyzed extensive catalogs of structural variants. Interordinal relationships exhibit relatively low rates of phylogenomic conflict across diverse datasets and analytical methods. Conversely, X-chromosome versus autosome conflicts characterize multiple independent clades that radiated during the Cenozoic. Genomic time trees reveal an accumulation of cladogenic events before and immediately after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, implying important roles for Cretaceous continental vicariance and the K-Pg extinction in the placental radiation.",

    "title": "smartPARE: An R Package for Efficient Identification of True mRNA Cleavage Sites.",
    "abstract": "Degradome sequencing is commonly used to generate high-throughput information on mRNA cleavage sites mediated by small RNAs (sRNA). In our datasets of potato (Solanum tuberosum, St) and Phytophthora infestans (Pi), initial predictions generated high numbers of cleavage site predictions, which highlighted the need of improved analytic tools. Here, we present an R package based on a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) in a machine learning environment to optimize discrimination of false from true cleavage sites. When applying smartPARE to our datasets on potato during the infection process by the late blight pathogen, 7.3% of all cleavage windows represented true cleavages distributed on 214 sites in P. infestans and 444 sites in potato. The sRNA landscape of the two organisms is complex with uneven sRNA production and cleavage regions widespread in the two genomes. Multiple targets and several cases of complex regulatory cascades, particularly in potato, was revealed. We conclude that our new analytic approach is useful for anyone working on complex biological systems and with the interest of identifying cleavage sites particularly inferred by sRNA classes beyond miRNAs.",

    "title": "Does antifouling paint select for antibiotic resistance?",
    "abstract": "There is concern that heavy metals and biocides contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance via co-selection. Most antifouling paints contain high amounts of such substances, which risks turning painted ship hulls into highly mobile refuges and breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objectives of this study were to start investigate if heavy-metal based antifouling paints can pose a risk for co-selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, if so, identify the underlying genetic basis. Plastic panels with one side painted with copper and zinc-containing antifouling paint were submerged in a Swedish marina and biofilms from both sides of the panels were harvested after 2.5-4weeks. DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, gentamicin, copper sulfate or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and ISCR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms.",

    "title": "Microbial communities mediating net methylmercury formation along a trophic gradient in a peatland chronosequence.",
    "abstract": "Peatlands are generally important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) to adjacent aquatic ecosystems, increasing the risk of human and wildlife exposure to this highly toxic compound. While microorganisms play important roles in mercury (Hg) geochemical cycles where they directly and indirectly affect MeHg formation in peatlands, potential linkages between net MeHg formation and microbial communities involving these microorganisms remain unclear. To address this gap, microbial community composition and specific marker gene transcripts were investigated along a trophic gradient in a geographically constrained peatland chronosequence. Our results showed a clear spatial pattern in microbial community composition along the gradient that was highly driven by peat soil properties and significantly associated with net MeHg formation as approximated by MeHg concentration and %MeHg of total Hg concentration. Known fermentative, syntrophic, methanogenic and iron-reducing metabolic guilds had the strong positive correlations to net MeHg formation, while methanotrophic and methylotrophic microorganisms were negatively correlated. Our results indicated that sulfate reducers did not have a key role in net MeHg formation. Microbial activity as interpreted from 16S rRNA sequences was significantly correlated with MeHg and %MeHg. Our findings shed new light on the role of microbial community in net MeHg formation of peatlands that undergo ontogenetic change.",

    "title": "Validation of Novel Prognostic Biomarkers for Early-Stage Clear-Cell, Endometrioid and Mucinous Ovarian Carcinomas Using Immunohistochemistry.",
    "abstract": "Early-stage (I and II) ovarian carcinoma patients generally have good prognosis. Yet, some patients die earlier than expected. Thus, it is important to stratify early-stage patients into risk groups to identify those in need of more aggressive treatment regimens. The prognostic value of 29 histotype-specific biomarkers identified using RNA sequencing was evaluated for early-stage clear-cell (CCC), endometrioid (EC) and mucinous (MC) ovarian carcinomas (n = 112) using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Biomarkers with prognostic significance were further evaluated in an external ovarian carcinoma data set using the web-based Kaplan-Meier plotter tool. Here, we provide evidence of aberrant protein expression patterns and prognostic significance of 17 novel histotype-specific prognostic biomarkers [10 for CCC (ARPC2, CCT5, GNB1, KCTD10, NUP155, RPL13A, RPL37, SETD3, SMYD2, TRIO), three for EC (CECR1, KIF26B, PIK3CA), and four for MC (CHEK1, FOXM1, KIF23, PARPBP)], suggesting biological heterogeneity within the histotypes. Combined predictive models comprising the protein expression status of the validated CCC, EC and MC biomarkers together with established clinical markers (age, stage, CA125, ploidy) improved the predictive power in comparison with models containing established clinical markers alone, further strengthening the importance of the biomarkers in ovarian carcinoma. Further, even improved predictive powers were demonstrated when combining these models with our previously identified prognostic biomarkers PITHD1 (CCC) and GPR158 (MC). Moreover, the proteins demonstrated improved risk prediction of CCC-, EC-, and MC-associated ovarian carcinoma survival. The novel histotype-specific prognostic biomarkers may not only improve prognostication and patient stratification of early-stage ovarian carcinomas, but may also guide future clinical therapy decisions.",

    "title": "A Chromosome-Level Genome Assembly and Annotation for the Clouded Apollo Butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne): A Species of Global Conservation Concern.",
    "abstract": "The clouded apollo (Parnassius mnemosyne) is a palearctic butterfly distributed over a large part of western Eurasia, but population declines and fragmentation have been observed in many parts of the range. The development of genomic tools can help to shed light on the genetic consequences of the decline and to make informed decisions about direct conservation actions. Here, we present a high-contiguity, chromosome-level genome assembly of a female clouded apollo butterfly and provide detailed annotations of genes and transposable elements. We find that the large genome (1.5 Gb) of the clouded apollo is extraordinarily repeat rich (73%). Despite that, the combination of sequencing techniques allowed us to assemble all chromosomes (nc = 29) to a high degree of completeness. The annotation resulted in a relatively high number of protein-coding genes (22,854) compared with other Lepidoptera, of which a large proportion (21,635) could be assigned functions based on homology with other species. A comparative analysis indicates that overall genome structure has been largely conserved, both within the genus and compared with the ancestral lepidopteran karyotype. The high-quality genome assembly and detailed annotation presented here will constitute an important tool for forthcoming efforts aimed at understanding the genetic consequences of fragmentation and decline, as well as for assessments of genetic diversity, population structure, inbreeding, and genetic load in the clouded apollo butterfly.",

    "title": "Frailty and the risk of dementia: is the association explained by shared environmental and genetic factors?",
    "abstract": "Frailty has been identified as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, it is not known whether familial factors, such as genetics and shared environmental factors, underlie this association. We analyzed the association between frailty and the risk of dementia in a large twin cohort and examined the role of familial factors in the association.\n\nThe Rockwood frailty index (FI) based on 44 health deficits was used to assess frailty. The population-level association between FI and the risk of all-cause dementia was analyzed in 41,550 participants of the Screening Across the Lifespan Twin (SALT) study (full sample, aged 41-97 years at baseline), using Cox and competing risk models. A subsample of 10,487 SALT participants aged 65 and older who received a cognitive assessment (cognitive sample) was used in a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of baseline cognitive level on the FI-dementia association. To analyze the influence of familial effects on the FI-dementia association, a within-pair analysis was performed. The within-pair model was also used to assess whether the risk conferred by frailty varies by age at FI assessment.\n\nA total of 3183 individuals were diagnosed with dementia during the 19-year follow-up. A 10% increase in FI was associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.18)) in the full sample adjusted for age, sex, education, and tobacco use. A significant association was likewise found in the cognitive sample, with an HR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.09, 1.20), adjusted for age, sex, and cognitive level at baseline. The associations were not attenuated when adjusted for APOE ɛ4 carrier status or considering the competing risk of death. After adjusting for familial effects, we found no evidence for statistically significant attenuation of the effect. The risk conferred by higher FI on dementia was constant after age 50 until very old age.\n\nA higher level of frailty predicts the risk of dementia and the association appears independent of familial factors. Targeting frailty might thus contribute to preventing or delaying dementia.",

    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence show that modern humans interbred with archaic Denisovans. Here, we report an account of shared demographic history between Australasians and Denisovans distinctively in Island Southeast Asia. Our analyses are based on ∼2.3 million genotypes from 118 ethnic groups of the Philippines, including 25 diverse self-identified Negrito populations, along with high-coverage genomes of Australopapuans and Ayta Magbukon Negritos. We show that Ayta Magbukon possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world-∼30%-40% greater than that of Australians and Papuans-consistent with an independent admixture event into Negritos from Denisovans. Together with the recently described Homo luzonensis, we suggest that there were multiple archaic species that inhabited the Philippines prior to the arrival of modern humans and that these archaic groups may have been genetically related. Altogether, our findings unveil a complex intertwined history of modern and archaic humans in the Asia-Pacific region, where distinct Islander Denisovan populations differentially admixed with incoming Australasians across multiple locations and at various points in time.",

    "abstract": "Combined measurements of mRNA and protein expression in single cells enable in-depth analysis of cellular states. We present SPARC, an approach that combines single-cell RNA-sequencing with proximity extension essays to simultaneously measure global mRNA and 89 intracellular proteins in individual cells. We show that mRNA expression fails to accurately reflect protein abundance at the time of measurement, although the direction of changes is in agreement during neuronal differentiation. Moreover, protein levels of transcription factors better predict their downstream effects than do their corresponding transcripts. Finally, we highlight that protein expression variation is overall lower than mRNA variation, but relative protein variation does not reflect the mRNA level. Our results demonstrate that mRNA and protein measurements in single cells provide different and complementary information regarding cell states. SPARC presents a state-of-the-art co-profiling method that overcomes current limitations in throughput and protein localization, including removing the need for cell fixation.",

    "abstract": "To identify and characterize genetic loci associated with the risk of developing ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV).\n\nGenetic association analyses were performed after Illumina sequencing of 1853 genes and subsequent replication with genotyping of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in a total cohort of 1110 Scandinavian cases with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, and 1589 controls. A novel AAV-associated single nucleotide polymorphism was analysed for allele-specific effects on gene expression using luciferase reporter assay.\n\nPR3-ANCA+ AAV was significantly associated with two independent loci in the HLA-DPB1/HLA-DPA1 region [rs1042335, P = 6.3 × 10-61, odds ratio (OR) 0.10; rs9277341, P = 1.5 × 10-44, OR 0.22] and with rs28929474 in the SERPINA1 gene (P = 2.7 × 10-10, OR 2.9). MPO-ANCA+ AAV was significantly associated with the HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2 locus (rs9274619, P = 5.4 × 10-25, OR 3.7) and with a rare variant in the BACH2 gene (rs78275221, P = 7.9 × 10-7, OR 3.0), the latter a novel susceptibility locus for MPO-ANCA+ granulomatosis with polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis. The rs78275221-A risk allele reduced luciferase gene expression in endothelial cells, specifically, as compared with the non-risk allele.\n\nWe identified a novel susceptibility locus for MPO-ANCA+ AAV and propose that the associated variant is of mechanistic importance, exerting a regulatory function on gene expression in specific cell types.",

    "title": "Streamlined and Abundant Bacterioplankton Thrive in Functional Cohorts.",
    "abstract": "While fastidious microbes can be abundant and ubiquitous in their natural communities, many fail to grow axenically in laboratories due to auxotrophies or other dependencies. To overcome auxotrophies, these microbes rely on their surrounding cohort. A cohort may consist of kin (ecotypes) or more distantly related organisms (community) with the cooperation being reciprocal or nonreciprocal and expensive (Black Queen hypothesis) or costless (by-product). These metabolic partnerships (whether at single species population or community level) enable dominance by and coexistence of these lineages in nature. Here we examine the relevance of these cooperation models to explain the abundance and ubiquity of the dominant fastidious bacterioplankton of a dimictic mesotrophic freshwater lake. Using both culture-dependent (dilution mixed cultures) and culture-independent (small subunit [SSU] rRNA gene time series and environmental metagenomics) methods, we independently identified the primary cohorts of actinobacterial genera \"Candidatus Planktophila\" (acI-A) and \"Candidatus Nanopelagicus\" (acI-B) and the proteobacterial genus \"Candidatus Fonsibacter\" (LD12). While \"Ca Planktophila\" and \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" had no correlation in their natural habitat, they have the potential to be complementary in laboratory settings. We also investigated the bifunctional catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG (a common good which \"Ca Planktophila\" is dependent upon) and its most likely providers in the lake. Further, we found that while ecotype and community cooperation combined may explain \"Ca Planktophila\" population abundance, the success of \"Ca. Nanopelagicus\" and \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" is better explained as a community by-product. Ecotype differentiation of \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" as a means of escaping predation was supported but not for overcoming auxotrophies.IMPORTANCE This study examines evolutionary and ecological relationships of three of the most ubiquitous and abundant freshwater bacterial genera: \"Ca Planktophila\" (acI-A), \"Ca. Nanopelagicus\" (acI-B), and \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" (LD12). Due to high abundance, these genera might have a significant influence on nutrient cycling in freshwaters worldwide, and this study adds a layer of understanding to how seemingly competing clades of bacteria can coexist by having different cooperation strategies. Our synthesis ties together network and ecological theory with empirical evidence and lays out a framework for how the functioning of populations within complex microbial communities can be studied.",

    "title": "Small RNA Response to Infection of the Insect-Specific Lammi Virus and Hanko Virus in an Aedes albopictus Cell Line.",
    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated antiviral immunity is believed to be the primary defense against viral infection in mosquitoes. The production of virus-specific small RNA has been demonstrated in mosquitoes and mosquito-derived cell lines for viruses in all of the major arbovirus families. However, many if not all mosquitoes are infected with a group of viruses known as insect-specific viruses (ISVs), and little is known about the mosquito immune response to this group of viruses. Therefore, in this study, we sequenced small RNA from an Aedes albopictus-derived cell line infected with either Lammi virus (LamV) or Hanko virus (HakV). These viruses belong to two distinct phylogenetic groups of insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs). The results revealed that both viruses elicited a strong virus-derived small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) response that increased over time and that targeted the whole viral genome, with a few predominant hotspots observed. Furthermore, only the LamV-infected cells produced virus-derived Piwi-like RNAs (vpiRNAs); however, they were mainly derived from the antisense genome and did not show the typical ping-pong signatures. HakV, which is more distantly related to the dual-host flaviviruses than LamV, may lack certain unknown sequence elements or structures required for vpiRNA production. Our findings increase the understanding of mosquito innate immunity and ISFVs' effects on their host.",

    "title": "The trans-ancestral genomic architecture of glycemic traits.",
    "abstract": "Glycemic traits are used to diagnose and monitor type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic health. To date, most genetic studies of glycemic traits have focused on individuals of European ancestry. Here we aggregated genome-wide association studies comprising up to 281,416 individuals without diabetes (30% non-European ancestry) for whom fasting glucose, 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge, glycated hemoglobin and fasting insulin data were available. Trans-ancestry and single-ancestry meta-analyses identified 242 loci (99 novel; P < 5 × 10-8), 80% of which had no significant evidence of between-ancestry heterogeneity. Analyses restricted to individuals of European ancestry with equivalent sample size would have led to 24 fewer new loci. Compared with single-ancestry analyses, equivalent-sized trans-ancestry fine-mapping reduced the number of estimated variants in 99% credible sets by a median of 37.5%. Genomic-feature, gene-expression and gene-set analyses revealed distinct biological signatures for each trait, highlighting different underlying biological pathways. Our results increase our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology by using trans-ancestry studies for improved power and resolution.",

    "title": "Dual RNA Sequencing Reveals Key Events When Different Giardia Life Cycle Stages Interact With Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells In Vitro.",
    "abstract": "Giardia intestinalis is a protozoan parasite causing diarrheal disease, giardiasis, after extracellular infection of humans and other mammals' intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of the upper small intestine. The parasite has two main life cycle stages: replicative trophozoites and transmissive cysts. Differentiating parasites (encysting cells) and trophozoites have recently been shown to be present in the same regions of the upper small intestine, whereas most mature cysts are found further down in the intestinal system. To learn more about host-parasite interactions during Giardia infections, we used an in vitro model of the parasite's interaction with host IECs (differentiated Caco-2 cells) and Giardia WB trophozoites, early encysting cells (7 h), and cysts. Dual RNA sequencing (Dual RNAseq) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in both Giardia and the IECs, which might relate to establishing infection and disease induction. In the human cells, the largest gene expression changes were found in immune and MAPK signaling, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cholesterol metabolism and oxidative stress. The different life cycle stages of Giardia induced a core of similar DEGs but at different levels and there are many life cycle stage-specific DEGs. The metabolic protein PCK1, the transcription factors HES7, HEY1 and JUN, the peptide hormone CCK and the mucins MUC2 and MUC5A are up-regulated in the IECs by trophozoites but not cysts. Cysts specifically induce the chemokines CCL4L2, CCL5 and CXCL5, the signaling protein TRKA and the anti-bacterial protein WFDC12. The parasite, in turn, up-regulated a large number of hypothetical genes, high cysteine membrane proteins (HCMPs) and oxidative stress response genes. Early encysting cells have unique DEGs compared to trophozoites (e.g. several uniquely up-regulated HCMPs) and interaction of these cells with IECs affected the encystation process. Our data show that different life cycle stages of Giardia induce different gene expression responses in the host cells and that the IECs in turn differentially affect the gene expression in trophozoites and early encysting cells. This life cycle stage-specific host-parasite cross-talk is an important aspect to consider during further studies of Giardia's molecular pathogenesis.",

    "title": "The genomic basis and environmental correlates of local adaptation in the Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus).",
    "abstract": "Understanding how populations adapt to their environment is increasingly important to prevent biodiversity loss due to overexploitation and climate change. Here we studied the population structure and genetic basis of local adaptation of Atlantic horse mackerel, a commercially and ecologically important marine fish that has one of the widest distributions in the eastern Atlantic. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing and environmental data of samples collected from the North Sea to North Africa and the western Mediterranean Sea. Our genomic approach indicated low population structure with a major split between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and between locations north and south of mid-Portugal. Populations from the North Sea are the most genetically distinct in the Atlantic. We discovered that most population structure patterns are driven by a few highly differentiated putatively adaptive loci. Seven loci discriminate the North Sea, two the Mediterranean Sea, and a large putative inversion (9.9 Mb) on chromosome 21 underlines the north-south divide and distinguishes North Africa. A genome-environment association analysis indicates that mean seawater temperature and temperature range, or factors correlated to them, are likely the main environmental drivers of local adaptation. Our genomic data broadly support the current stock divisions, but highlight areas of potential mixing, which require further investigation. Moreover, we demonstrate that as few as 17 highly informative SNPs can genetically discriminate the North Sea and North African samples from neighboring populations. Our study highlights the importance of both, life history and climate-related selective pressures in shaping population structure patterns in marine fish. It also supports that chromosomal rearrangements play a key role in local adaptation with gene flow. This study provides the basis for more accurate delineation of the horse mackerel stocks and paves the way for improving stock assessments.",

    "abstract": "How sexual selection affects the genome ultimately relies on the strength and type of selection, and the genetic architecture of the involved traits. While associating genotype with phenotype often utilizes standard trait morphology, trait representations in morphospace using geometric morphometric approaches receive less focus in this regard. Here, we identify genetic associations to a sexual ornament, the comb, in the chicken system (Gallus gallus). Our approach combined genome-wide genotype and gene expression data (>30k genes) with different aspects of comb morphology in an advanced intercross line (F8) generated by crossing a wild-type Red Junglefowl with a domestic breed of chicken (White Leghorn). In total, 10 quantitative trait loci were found associated to various aspects of comb shape and size, while 1,184 expression QTL were found associated to gene expression patterns, among which 98 had overlapping confidence intervals with those of quantitative trait loci. Our results highlight both known genomic regions confirming previous records of a large effect quantitative trait loci associated to comb size, and novel quantitative trait loci associated to comb shape. Genes were considered candidates affecting comb morphology if they were found within both confidence intervals of the underlying quantitative trait loci and eQTL. Overlaps between quantitative trait loci and genome-wide selective sweeps identified in a previous study revealed that only loci associated to comb size may be experiencing on-going selection under domestication.",

    "title": "Similarity in milk microbiota in replicates.",
    "abstract": "Receiving the same results from repeated analysis of the same sample is a basic principle in science. The inability to reproduce previously published results has led to discussions of a reproducibility crisis within science. For studies of microbial communities, the problem of reproducibility is more pronounced and has, in some fields, led to a discussion on the very existence of a constantly present microbiota. In this study, DNA from 44 bovine milk samples were extracted twice and the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced in two separate runs. The FASTQ files from the two data sets were run through the same bioinformatics pipeline using the same settings and results from the two data sets were compared. Milk samples collected maximally 2 h apart were used as replicates and permitted comparisons to be made within the same run. Results show a significant difference in species richness between the two sequencing runs although Shannon and Simpson's diversity was the same. Multivariate analyses of all samples demonstrate that the sequencing run was a driver for variation. Direct comparison of similarity between samples and sequencing run showed an average similarity of 42%-45% depending on whether binary or abundance-based similarity indices were used. Within-run comparisons of milk samples collected maximally 2 h apart showed an average similarity of 39%-47% depending on the similarity index used and that similarity differed significantly between runs. We conclude that repeated DNA extraction and sequencing significantly can affect the results of a low microbial biomass microbiota study.",

    "abstract": "Rhodotorula toruloides is an oleaginous yeast with high biotechnological potential. In order to understand the molecular physiology of lipid synthesis in R. toruloides and to advance metabolic engineering, a high-resolution genome is required. We constructed a genome draft of R. toruloides CBS 14, using a hybrid assembly approach, consisting of short and long reads generated by Illumina and Nanopore sequencing, respectively. The genome draft consists of 23 contigs and 3 scaffolds, with a N50 length of 1,529,952 bp, thus largely representing chromosomal organization. The total size of the genome is 20,534,857 bp and the overall GC content is 61.83%. Transcriptomic data from different growth conditions was used to aid species-specific gene annotation. We annotated 9464 genes and identified 11,691 transcripts. Furthermore, we demonstrated the presence of a potential plasmid, an extrachromosomal circular structure of about 11 kb with a copy number about three times as high as the other chromosomes.",
