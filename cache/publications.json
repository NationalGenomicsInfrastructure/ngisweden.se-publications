    "title": "The role of germline alterations in the DNA damage response genes BRIP1 and BRCA2 in melanoma susceptibility.",
    "abstract": "We applied a targeted sequencing approach to identify germline mutations conferring a moderately to highly increased risk of cutaneous and uveal melanoma. Ninety-two high-risk melanoma patients were screened for inherited variation in 120 melanoma candidate genes. Observed gene variants were filtered based on frequency in reference populations, cosegregation with melanoma in families and predicted functional effect. Several novel or rare genetic variants in genes involved in DNA damage response, cell-cycle regulation and transcriptional control were identified in melanoma patients. Among identified genetic alterations was an extremely rare variant (minor allele frequency of 0.00008) in the BRIP1 gene that was found to cosegregate with the melanoma phenotype. We also found a rare nonsense variant in the BRCA2 gene (rs11571833), previously associated with cancer susceptibility but not with melanoma, which showed weak association with melanoma susceptibility in the Swedish population. Our results add to the growing knowledge about genetic factors associated with melanoma susceptibility and also emphasize the role of DNA damage response as an important factor in melanoma etiology. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The WNT10A protein is critical for the development of ectodermal appendages. Variants in the WNT10A gene may be associated with a spectrum of ectodermal abnormalities including extensive tooth agenesis.\n\nIn seven patients with severe tooth agenesis we identified anomalies in primary dentition and additional ectodermal symptoms, and assessed WNT10A mutations by genetic analysis.\n\nInvestigation of primary dentition revealed peg-shaped crowns of primary mandibular incisors and three individuals had agenesis of at least two primary teeth. The permanent dentition was severely affected in all individuals with a mean of 21 missing teeth. Primary teeth were most often present in positions were succedaneous teeth were missing. Furthermore, most existing molars had taurodontism. Light, brittle or coarse hair was reported in all seven individuals, hyperhidrosis of palms and soles in six individuals and nail anomalies in two individuals. The anomalies in primary dentition preceded most of the additional ectodermal symptoms. Genetic analysis revealed that all seven individuals were homozygous or compound heterozygous for WNT10A mutations resulting in C107X, E222X and F228I.\n\nWe conclude that tooth agenesis and/or peg-shaped crowns of primary mandibular incisors, severe oligodontia of permanent dentition as well as ectodermal symptoms of varying severity may be predictors of bi-allelic WNT10A mutations of importance for diagnosis, counselling and follow-up.",

    "title": "METTL3 drives telomere targeting of TERRA lncRNA through m6A-dependent R-loop formation: a therapeutic target for ALT-positive neuroblastoma.",
    "abstract": "Telomerase-negative tumors maintain telomere length by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), but the underlying mechanism behind ALT remains poorly understood. A proportion of aggressive neuroblastoma (NB), particularly relapsed tumors, are positive for ALT (ALT+), suggesting that a better dissection of the ALT mechanism could lead to novel therapeutic opportunities. TERRA, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) derived from telomere ends, localizes to telomeres in a R-loop-dependent manner and plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance. Here we present evidence that RNA modification at the N6 position of internal adenosine (m6A) in TERRA by the methyltransferase METTL3 is essential for telomere maintenance in ALT+ cells, and the loss of TERRA m6A/METTL3 results in telomere damage. We observed that m6A modification is abundant in R-loop enriched TERRA, and the m6A-mediated recruitment of hnRNPA2B1 to TERRA is critical for R-loop formation. Our findings suggest that m6A drives telomere targeting of TERRA via R-loops, and this m6A-mediated R-loop formation could be a widespread mechanism employed by other chromatin-interacting lncRNAs. Furthermore, treatment of ALT+ NB cells with a METTL3 inhibitor resulted in compromised telomere targeting of TERRA and accumulation of DNA damage at telomeres, indicating that METTL3 inhibition may represent a therapeutic approach for ALT+ NB.",

    "title": "Utilizing museomics to trace the complex history and species boundaries in an avian-study system of conservation concern.",
    "abstract": "A taxonomic classification that accurately captures evolutionary history is essential for conservation. Genomics provides powerful tools for delimiting species and understanding their evolutionary relationships. This allows for a more accurate and detailed view on conservation status compared with other, traditionally used, methods. However, from a practical and ethical perspective, gathering sufficient samples for endangered taxa may be difficult. Here, we use museum specimens to trace the evolutionary history and species boundaries in an Asian oriole clade. The endangered silver oriole has long been recognized as a distinct species based on its unique coloration, but a recent study suggested that it might be nested within the maroon oriole-species complex. To evaluate species designation, population connectivity, and the corresponding conservation implications, we assembled a de novo genome and used whole-genome resequencing of historical specimens. Our results show that the silver orioles form a monophyletic lineage within the maroon oriole complex and that maroon and silver forms continued to interbreed after initial divergence, but do not show signs of recent gene flow. Using a genome scan, we identified genes that may form the basis for color divergence and act as reproductive barriers. Taken together, our results confirm the species status of the silver oriole and highlight that taxonomic revision of the maroon forms is urgently needed. Our study demonstrates how genomics and Natural History Collections (NHC) can be utilized to shed light on the taxonomy and evolutionary history of natural populations and how such insights can directly benefit conservation practitioners when assessing wild populations.",

    "abstract": "Gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) induce complex galls on oaks, roses, and other plants, but the mechanism of gall induction is still unknown. Here, we take a comparative genomic approach to revealing the genetic basis of gall induction. We focus on Synergus itoensis, a species that induces galls inside oak acorns. Previous studies suggested that this species evolved the ability to initiate gall formation recently, as it is deeply nested within the genus Synergus, whose members are mostly inquilines that develop inside the galls of other species. We compared the genome of S. itoensis with that of three related Synergus inquilines to identify genomic changes associated with the origin of gall induction. We used a novel Bayesian selection analysis, which accounts for branch-specific and gene-specific selection effects, to search for signatures of selection in 7,600 single-copy orthologous genes shared by the four Synergus species. We found that the terminal branch leading to S. itoensis had more genes with a significantly elevated dN/dS ratio (positive signature genes) than the other terminal branches in the tree; the S. itoensis branch also had more genes with a significantly decreased dN/dS ratio. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that the positive signature gene set of S. itoensis, unlike those of the inquiline species, is enriched in several biological process Gene Ontology terms, the most prominent of which is \"Ovarian Follicle Cell Development.\" Our results indicate that the origin of gall induction is associated with distinct genomic changes, and provide a good starting point for further characterization of the genes involved.",

    "title": "Recent advances in crayfish hematopoietic stem cell culture: a model for studies of hemocyte differentiation and immunity.",
    "abstract": "Hematopoiesis is the process by which blood cells (hemocytes) mature and subsequently enter the circulation and we have developed a new technique to culture the hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. The reason for the successful culture was the isolation of a plasma protein that turned out to be a novel cytokine, astakine 1 (Ast1) containing a domain present in several vertebrates, so-called prokineticins. Now we have detected several astakines from other invertebrate species. Depending on our discovery of the cytokine Ast1 we have an opportunity to study in detail the differentiation of cells in the hematopoietic tissue of a crustacean, a tissue of evolutionary interest for studies of the connection between the vascular system and the nervous system. We have been able to isolate the entire hematopoietic tissue and for the first time detected a link between this tissue and the brain. We have further localized a proliferation center in the tissue and characterized its different parts. We have also used this system to isolate a new hematopoietic factor CHF that is important in the crossroad between apoptosis and hemocyte differentiation. Our technique for culture of crayfish hematopoietic stem cells provides a simple tool for studying the mechanism of hematopoiesis, but also enables detailed studies of immune defense reactions. Further, the culture system has been used for studies of viral defense and the system is suitable for gene silencing which allows functional characterization of different molecules involved in host defense as well as in hemocyte differentiation.",

    "abstract": "To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL.",

    "abstract": "Dietary factors may regulate the epigenome. We aimed to explore whether a diet intervention, including excess sugar, affects the methylome in human sperm, and to describe the sperm methylome. We used Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) to analyze DNA methylation in sperm taken at three time points from 15 males during a diet intervention; i) at baseline, ii) after one week on a standardized diet, and iii) after an additional week on a high-sugar diet providing 150% of their estimated total energy expenditure.\n\nWe identified seven nominal diet-associated differentially methylated regions in sperm (p < 0.05). The diet was nominally associated with methylation of 143 sites linked to fertility (e.g. AHRR, GNAS, and HDAC4), 313 sites in imprinted genes (e.g. GLIS3, PEG10, PEG3, and SNURF), and 42 sites in top 1%-expressed genes (e.g. CHD2) (p < 0.05). In sperm, 3'UTRs and introns had the highest levels of methylation, while 5'UTRs and CpG islands had the lowest levels. Non-expressed genes in human sperm were hypomethylated in exons compared with transcribed genes.\n\nIn human sperm, DNA methylation levels were linked to gene expression, and excess sugar had modest effects on methylation on imprinted and highly expressed genes, and genes affecting fertility.",

We perform an unbiased analysis of 12,930 whole-blood derived CpG-sites (Illumina Infinium EPIC BeadChip) previously demonstrated to be more conciliable with brain-derived variations. The candidate site was validated by pyrosequencing. External replication was performed in (1) relation to age at index suicide attempt in 97 women with emotionally unstable personality disorder (whole-blood) and (2) death by suicide in a mixed group of 183 prefrontal-cortex (PFC) derived samples who died by suicide or from non-psychiatric etiologies.\n\nCYP2D6-coupled CpG-site cg07016288 was hypomethylated in severe suicidal behavior (p < 10E-06). Results were validated by pyrosequencing (p < 0.01). Replication analyses demonstrate hypomethylation of cg07016288 in relation to age at index SA in females (p < 0.05) and hypermethylation in PFC of male suicide completers (p < 0.05).\n\nGenotyping of CYP2D6 was not performed and CpG-site associations to gene expression were not explored.\n\nCYP2D6-coupled epigenetic markers are hypomethylated in females in dependency of features known to confer increased risk of suicide deaths and hypermethylated in PFC of male suicide completers.

    "title": "Low Energy Electron Irradiation Is a Potent Alternative to Gamma Irradiation for the Inactivation of (CAR-)NK-92 Cells in ATMP Manufacturing.",
    "abstract": "With increasing clinical use of NK-92 cells and their CAR-modified derivatives in cancer immunotherapy, there is a growing demand for efficient production processes of these \"off-the-shelf\" therapeutics. In order to ensure safety and prevent the occurrence of secondary tumors, (CAR-)NK-92 cell proliferation has to be inactivated before transfusion. This is commonly achieved by gamma irradiation. Recently, we showed proof of concept that low energy electron irradiation (LEEI) is a new method for NK-92 inactivation. LEEI has several advantages over gamma irradiation, including a faster reaction time, a more reproducible dose rate and much less requirements on radiation shielding. Here, LEEI was further evaluated as a promising alternative to gamma irradiation yielding cells with highly maintained cytotoxic effector function.\n\nEffectiveness and efficiency of LEEI and gamma irradiation were analyzed using NK-92 and CD123-directed CAR-NK-92 cells. LEE-irradiated cells were extensively characterized and compared to gamma-irradiated cells via flow cytometry, cytotoxicity assays, and comet assays, amongst others.\n\nOur results show that both irradiation methods caused a progressive decrease in cell viability and are, therefore, suitable for inhibition of cell proliferation. Notably, the NK-mediated specific lysis of tumor cells was maintained at stable levels for three days post-irradiation, with a trend towards higher activities after LEEI treatment as compared to gamma irradiation. Both gamma irradiation as well as LEEI led to substantial DNA damage and an accumulation of irradiated cells in the G2/M cell cycle phases. In addition, transcriptomic analysis of irradiated cells revealed approximately 12-fold more differentially expressed genes two hours after gamma irradiation, compared to LEEI. Analysis of surface molecules revealed an irradiation-induced decrease in surface expression of CD56, but no changes in the levels of the activating receptors NKp46, NKG2D, or NKp30.\n\nThe presented data show that LEEI inactivates (CAR-)NK-92 cells as efficiently as gamma irradiation, but with less impact on the overall gene expression. Due to logistic advantages, LEEI might provide a superior alternative for the manufacture of (CAR-)NK-92 cells for clinical application.",

    "title": "Phylogenetic relationships of rollers (Coraciidae) based on complete mitochondrial genomes and fifteen nuclear genes.",
    "abstract": "The rollers (Coraciidae) constitute a relative small avian family with ca. 12 species distributed in Africa, western and southern Eurasia, and eastern Australia. In this study we examine the phylogenetic relationships of all species currently recognized in the family, including two taxa whose taxonomic status is currently contested. By using shotgun sequencing on degraded DNA from museum study skins we have been able to recover complete mitochondrial genomes as well as 15 nuclear genes for in total 16 taxa. The gene sequences were analyzed both concatenated in a maximum likelihood framework as well in a species tree approach using MP-EST. The different analytical approaches yield similar, highly supported trees and support the current division of the rollers into two genera, Coracias and Eurystomus. The only conflict relates to the placement of the Blue-bellied Roller (C. cyanogaster), where the mitochondrial, and the concatenated nuclear and mitochondrial data set, place this taxon as sister to the other Coracias species, whereas nuclear data and the species tree analysis place it as the sister taxon of C. naevia and C. spatulatus. All analyses place the Eurasian roller (C. garrulus) with the two African species, Abyssinian Roller (C. abyssinica) and Liliac-breasted Roller (C. caudatus), and place this clade as the sister group to the Asian Coracias rollers. In addition, our results support a sister group relationship between the morphologically rather dissimilar Purple Roller (C. naevia) and Racquet-tailed Roller (C. spatulatus) and also support the division of Eurystomus in an African and an Asian clade. However, within the Asian clade the Azure Roller (E. azureus) from Halmahera appears to be nested within the Dollarbird (E. orientalis), indicating that that this taxon is a morphological divergent, but a rather recent offshoot, of the widespread Dollarbird. Similarly, the Purple-winged Roller (C. temminickii) from Sulawesi group together with C. benghalensis affinis from Southeast Asia and these two in turn comprises the sister group to C. benghalensis benghalensis from India and western Asia.",

    "title": "Epigenome-wide analysis of frailty: Results from two European twin cohorts.",
    "abstract": "Epigenetics plays an important role in the aging process, but it is unclear whether epigenetic factors also influence frailty, an age-related state of physiological decline. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies in four samples drawn from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) and the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT) to explore the association between DNA methylation and frailty. Frailty was defined using the frailty index (FI), and DNA methylation levels were measured in whole blood using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K and MethylationEPIC arrays. In the meta-analysis consisting of a total of 829 participants, we identified 589 CpG sites that were statistically significantly associated with either the continuous or categorical FI (false discovery rate <0.05). Many of these CpGs have previously been associated with age and age-related diseases. The identified sites were also largely directionally consistent in a longitudinal analysis using mixed-effects models in SATSA, where the participants were followed up to a maximum of 20 years. Moreover, we identified three differentially methylated regions within the MGRN1, MIR596, and TAPBP genes that have been linked to neuronal aging, tumor growth, and immune functions. Furthermore, our meta-analysis results replicated 34 of the 77 previously reported frailty-associated CpGs at p < 0.05. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate robust associations between frailty and DNA methylation levels in 589 novel CpGs, previously unidentified for frailty, and strengthen the role of neuronal/brain pathways in frailty.",

    "title": "DNA methylation patterns contribute to changes of cellular differentiation pathways in leukocytes with LOY from patients with Alzheimer´s disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and increasing societal problem due to the extending human lifespan. In males, loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes is strongly associated with AD. We studied here DNA methylation and RNA expression in sorted monocytes and granulocytes with and without LOY from male AD patients. Through multi-omic analysis, we identified new candidate genes along with those previously associated with AD. Global analyses of DNA methylation in samples with LOY vs. normal state showed that hypomethylation dominated both in granulocytes and monocytes. Our findings highlight LOY-related differences in DNA methylation that occur in gene regulatory regions. Specifically, we observed alterations in key genes involved in leukocyte differentiation: FLI1, involved in early hematopoiesis; RUNX1, essential for blood cell development; RARA, regulating gene expression in response to retinoic acid; CANX, crucial for protein folding; CEBPB, a transcription factor important for immune responses; and MYADM, implicated in cell adhesion and migration. Moreover, protein-protein interaction analysis in granulocytes identified that products of two of these genes, CANX and CEBPB, are key hub proteins. This research underscores the potential of multi-omic approach in pure hematopoietic cell populations to uncover the molecular underpinnings of AD. Finally, our results link previous analysis showing impact of LOY on leukocyte differentiation, LOY-associated transcriptional dysregulation and GWAS studies of LOY.",

    "title": "Selection on accessible chromatin regions in Capsella grandiflora.",
    "abstract": "Accurate estimates of genome-wide rates and fitness effects of new mutations are essential for an improved understanding of molecular evolutionary processes. Although eukaryotic genomes generally contain a large non-coding fraction, functional non-coding regions and fitness effects of mutations in such regions are still incompletely characterized. A promising approach to characterize functional non-coding regions relies on identifying accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) tightly associated with regulatory DNA. Here, we applied this approach to identify and estimate selection on ACRs in Capsella grandiflora, a crucifer species ideal for population genomic quantification of selection due to its favourable population demography. We describe a population-wide ACR distribution based on ATAC-seq data for leaf samples of 16 individuals from a natural population. We use population genomic methods to estimate fitness effects and proportions of positively selected fixations (α) in ACRs and find that intergenic ACRs harbor a considerable fraction of weakly deleterious new mutations, as well as a significantly higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations than comparable inaccessible intergenic regions. ACRs are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and depleted of transposable element (TE) insertions, as expected if intergenic ACRs are under selection because they harbor regulatory regions. By integrating empirical identification of intergenic ACRs with analyses of eQTL and population genomic analyses of selection, we demonstrate that intergenic regulatory regions are an important source of nearly neutral mutations. These results improve our understanding of selection on non-coding regions and the role of nearly neutral mutations for evolutionary processes in outcrossing Brassicaceae species.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplast protein transport depends on the SEC1 translocase. Barley xan-m mutants, deficient in SECA1, lack chlorophyll and die as seedlings. Their yellow phenotype indicates that carotenoid chemistry is less SEC1-dependent. Chloroplast proteins encoded by genes located in the cell nucleus need to be transported across up to three chloroplast membranes to find its correct location. SEC1 is one of the major translocase systems. In plants, SEC1 consists of three proteins (SECA1, SECY1 and SECE1) and transports substrate proteins over the thylakoid membrane. SECA1 is an ATPase that delivers the substrate protein to the SECY1-SECE1 channel. In the present study, we analyzed five allelic barley xan-m mutants, which had been isolated between 1925 and 1957. The mutants belong to a larger collection of barley mutants deficient in chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development. Mutations in the xan-m gene are recessive and result in a yellow phenotype due to lack of chlorophyll and presence of carotenoids. Mutant seedlings die after approximately 10 days. We identified the defective gene in the xan-m mutants by a variant of bulk segregant analysis. The gene xan-m is an orthologue of SECA1 in Arabidopsis. Previously, only genes related to chlorophyll biosynthesis have been identified in the collection of barley xan mutants. The yellow phenotype of the mutants demonstrates that proteins responsible for carotenoid biosynthesis and storage are not or less dependent on an intact SEC1 translocase.",

    "abstract": "Previous large-scale studies have uncovered many features that determine the processing of microRNA (miRNA) precursors; however, they have been conducted in vitro. Here, we introduce MapToCleave, a method to simultaneously profile processing of thousands of distinct RNA structures in living cells. We find that miRNA precursors with a stable lower basal stem are more efficiently processed and also have higher expression in vivo in tissues from 20 animal species. We systematically compare the importance of known and novel sequence and structural features and test biogenesis of miRNA precursors from 10 animal and plant species in human cells. Lastly, we provide evidence that the GHG motif better predicts processing when defined as a structure rather than sequence motif, consistent with recent cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. In summary, we apply a screening assay in living cells to reveal the importance of lower basal stem stability for miRNA processing and in vivo expression.",

    "title": "Placental growth factor exerts a dual function for cardiomyogenesis and vasculogenesis during heart development.",
    "abstract": "Cardiogenic growth factors play important roles in heart development. Placental growth factor (PLGF) has previously been reported to have angiogenic effects; however, its potential role in cardiogenesis has not yet been determined. We analyze single-cell RNA-sequencing data derived from human and primate embryonic hearts and find PLGF shows a biphasic expression pattern, as it is expressed specifically on ISL1+ second heart field progenitors at an earlier stage and on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) at later stages. Using chemically modified mRNAs (modRNAs), we generate a panel of cardiogenic growth factors and test their effects on enhancing cardiomyocyte (CM) and EC induction during different stages of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiations. We discover that only the application of PLGF modRNA at early time points of hESC-CM differentiation can increase both CM and EC production. Conversely, genetic deletion of PLGF reduces generation of CMs, SMCs and ECs in vitro. We also confirm in vivo beneficial effects of PLGF modRNA for development of human heart progenitor-derived cardiac muscle grafts on murine kidney capsules. Further, we identify the previously unrecognized PLGF-related transcriptional networks driven by EOMES and SOX17. These results shed light on the dual cardiomyogenic and vasculogenic effects of PLGF during heart development.",

    "title": "Long noncoding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 is overexpressed in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and exon 2 is critical for its oncogenicity.",
    "abstract": "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most common and fastest increasing forms of cancer worldwide with metastatic potential. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of RNA molecules with essential regulatory functions in both physiological and pathological processes.\n\nTo investigate the function and mode of action of lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in cSCC.\n\nQuantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and single-molecule in situ hybridization were used to quantify the expression level of PVT1 in normal skin, premalignant skin lesions, actinic keratosis (AK) and primary and metastatic cSCCs. The function of PVT1 in cSCC was investigated both in vivo (tumour xenografts) and in vitro (competitive cell growth assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, colony formation assay and tumour spheroid formation assay) upon CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the entire PVT1 locus, the knockout of exon 2 of PVT1, and locked nucleic acid (LNA) gapmer-mediated PVT1 knockdown. RNA sequencing analysis was conducted to identify genes and processes regulated by PVT1.\n\nWe identified PVT1 as a lncRNA upregulated in cSCC in situ and cSCC, associated with the malignant phenotype of cSCC. We showed that the expression of PVT1 in cSCC was regulated by MYC. Both CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the entire PVT1 locus and LNA gapmer-mediated knockdown of PVT1 transcript impaired the malignant behaviour of cSCC cells, suggesting that PVT1 is an oncogenic transcript in cSCC. Furthermore, knockout of PVT1 exon 2 inhibited cSCC tumour growth both in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating that exon 2 is a critical element for the oncogenic role of PVT1. Mechanistically, we showed that PVT1 was localized in the cell nucleus and its deletion resulted in cellular senescence, increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21/CDKN1A) expression and cell cycle arrest.\n\nOur study revealed a previously unrecognized role for exon 2 of PVT1 in its oncogenic role and that PVT1 suppresses cellular senescence in cSCC. PVT1 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cSCC.",

    "title": "Life-history adaptation under climate warming magnifies the agricultural footprint of a cosmopolitan insect pest.",
    "abstract": "Climate change is affecting population growth rates of ectothermic pests with potentially dire consequences for agriculture and global food security. However, current projection models of pest impact typically overlook the potential for rapid genetic adaptation, making current forecasts uncertain. Here, we predict how climate change adaptation in life-history traits of insect pests affects their growth rates and impact on agricultural yields by unifying thermodynamics with classic theory on resource acquisition and allocation trade-offs between foraging, reproduction, and maintenance. Our model predicts that warming temperatures will favour resource allocation towards maintenance coupled with increased resource acquisition through larval foraging, and the evolution of this life-history strategy results in both increased population growth rates and per capita host consumption, causing a double-blow on agricultural yields. We find support for these predictions by studying thermal adaptation in life-history traits and gene expression in the wide-spread insect pest, Callosobruchus maculatus; with 5 years of evolution under experimental warming causing an almost two-fold increase in its predicted agricultural footprint. These results show that pest adaptation can offset current projections of agricultural impact and emphasize the need for integrating a mechanistic understanding of life-history evolution into forecasts of pest impact under climate change.",

    "title": "Association of TMEM18 variants with BMI and waist circumference in children and correlation of mRNA expression in the PFC with body weight in rats.",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have shown a strong association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the near vicinity of the TMEM18 gene. The effects of the TMEM18-associated variants are more readily observed in children. TMEM18 encodes a 3TM protein, which locates to the nuclear membrane. The functional context of TMEM18 and the effects of its associated variants are as of yet undetermined. To further explore the effects of near-TMEM18 variants, we have genotyped two TMEM18-associated SNPs, rs6548238 and rs4854344, in a cohort of 2352 Greek children (Healthy Growth Study). Included in this study are data on anthropomorphic traits body weight, BMI z-score and waist circumference. Also included are dietary energy and macronutrient intake as measured via 24-h recall interviews. Major alleles of rs6548238 and rs4854344 were significantly associated with an increased risk of obesity (odds ratio = 1.489 (1.161-1.910) and 1.494 (1.165-1.917), respectively), and positively correlated to body weight (P = 0.017, P = 0.010) and waist circumference (P = 0.003, P = 0.003). An association to energy and macronutrient intake was not observed in this cohort. We also correlated food intake and body weight in a food choice model in rats to Tmem18 expression in central regions involved in feeding behavior. We observed a strong positive correlation between TMEM18 expression and body weight in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (r = 0.5694, P = 0.0003) indicating a potential role for TMEM18 in higher functions related to feeding involving the PFC.",

    "title": "FOXO-regulated OSER1 reduces oxidative stress and extends lifespan in multiple species.",
    "abstract": "FOXO transcription factors modulate aging-related pathways and influence longevity in multiple species, but the transcriptional targets that mediate these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved FOXO target gene, Oxidative stress-responsive serine-rich protein 1 (OSER1), whose overexpression extends lifespan in silkworms, nematodes, and flies, while its depletion correspondingly shortens lifespan. In flies, overexpression of OSER1 increases resistance to oxidative stress, starvation, and heat shock, while OSER1-depleted flies are more vulnerable to these stressors. In silkworms, hydrogen peroxide both induces and is scavenged by OSER1 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of OSER1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to increased ROS production and shorter lifespan, mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased ATP production, and altered transcription of mitochondrial genes. Human proteomic analysis suggests that OSER1 plays roles in oxidative stress response, cellular senescence, and reproduction, which is consistent with the data and suggests that OSER1 could play a role in fertility in silkworms and nematodes. Human studies demonstrate that polymorphic variants in OSER1 are associated with human longevity. In summary, OSER1 is an evolutionarily conserved FOXO-regulated protein that improves resistance to oxidative stress, maintains mitochondrial functional integrity, and increases lifespan in multiple species. Additional studies will clarify the role of OSER1 as a critical effector of healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are important phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea, an estuarine-like environment with pronounced north to south gradients in salinity and nutrient concentrations. Here, we present a metagenomic and -transcriptomic survey, with subsequent analyses targeting the genetic identity, phylogenetic diversity, and spatial distribution of Baltic Sea cyanobacteria. The cyanobacterial community constituted close to 12% of the microbial population sampled during a pre-bloom period (June-July 2009). The community was dominated by unicellular picocyanobacteria, specifically a few highly abundant taxa (Synechococcus and Cyanobium) with a long tail of low abundance representatives, and local peaks of bloom-forming heterocystous taxa. Cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea differed genetically from those in adjacent limnic and marine waters as well as from cultivated and sequenced picocyanobacterial strains. Diversity peaked at brackish salinities 3.5-16 psu, with low N:P ratios. A shift in community composition from brackish to marine strains was accompanied by a change in the repertoire and expression of genes involved in salt acclimation. Overall, the pre-bloom cyanobacterial population was more genetically diverse, widespread and abundant than previously documented, with unicellular picocyanobacteria being the most abundant clade along the entire Baltic Sea salinity gradient.",

    "title": "Untreated urban waste contaminates Indian river sediments with resistance genes to last resort antibiotics.",
    "abstract": "Efficient sewage treatment is critical for limiting environmental transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In many low and middle income countries, however, large proportions of sewage are still released untreated into receiving water bodies. In-depth knowledge of how such discharges of untreated urban waste influences the environmental resistome is largely lacking. Here, we highlight the impact of uncontrolled discharge of partially treated and/or untreated wastewater on the structure of bacterial communities and resistome of sediments collected from Mutha river flowing through Pune city in India. Using shotgun metagenomics, we found a wide array (n = 175) of horizontally transferable antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including carbapenemases such as NDM, VIM, KPC, OXA-48 and IMP types. The relative abundance of total ARGs was 30-fold higher in river sediments within the city compared to upstream sites. Forty four ARGs, including the tet(X) gene conferring resistance to tigecycline, OXA-58 and GES type carbapenemases, were significantly more abundant in city sediments, while two ARGs were more common at upstream sites. The recently identified mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was detected only in one of the upstream samples, but not in city samples. In addition to ARGs, higher abundances of various mobile genetic elements were found in city samples, including integron-associated integrases and ISCR transposases, as well as some biocide/metal resistance genes. Virulence toxin genes as well as bacterial genera comprising many pathogens were more abundant here; the genus Acinetobacter, which is often associated with multidrug resistance and nosocomial infections, comprised up to 29% of the 16S rRNA reads, which to our best knowledge is unmatched in any other deeply sequenced metagenome. There was a strong correlation between the abundance of Acinetobacter and the OXA-58 carbapenemase gene. Our study shows that uncontrolled discharge of untreated urban waste can contribute to an overall increase of the abundance and diversity of ARGs in the environment, including those conferring resistance to last-resort antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is effective for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes, but some individuals do not achieve metabolic benefits from exercise (\"non-responders\"). We investigated non-responders in terms of insulin sensitivity changes following a 12-week supervised strength and endurance exercise program. We used a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp to measure insulin sensitivity among 26 men aged 40-65, categorizing them into non-responders or responders based on their insulin sensitivity change scores. The exercise regimen included VO2max, muscle strength, whole-body MRI scans, muscle and fat biopsies, and serum samples. mRNA sequencing was performed on biopsies and Olink proteomics on serum samples. Non-responders showed more visceral and intramuscular fat and signs of dyslipidaemia and low-grade inflammation at baseline and did not improve in insulin sensitivity following exercise, although they showed gains in VO2max and muscle strength. Impaired IL6-JAK-STAT3 signalling in non-responders was suggested by serum proteomics analysis, and a baseline serum proteomic machine learning (ML) algorithm predicted insulin sensitivity responses with high accuracy, validated across two independent exercise cohorts. The ML model identified 30 serum proteins that could forecast exercise-induced insulin sensitivity changes.",

    "title": "The Swedish Twin Registry: establishment of a biobank and other recent developments.",
    "abstract": "The Swedish Twin Registry (STR) today contains more than 194,000 twins and more than 75,000 pairs have zygosity determined by an intra-pair similarity algorithm, DNA, or by being of opposite sex. Of these, approximately 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 pairs are monozygotic, same-sex dizygotic, and opposite-sex dizygotic pairs, respectively. Since its establishment in the late 1950s, the STR has been an important epidemiological resource for the study of genetic and environmental influences on a multitude of traits, behaviors, and diseases. Following large investments in the collection of biological specimens in the past 10 years we have now established a Swedish twin biobank with DNA from 45,000 twins and blood serum from 15,000 twins, which effectively has also transformed the registry into a powerful resource for molecular studies. We here describe the main projects within which the new collections of both biological samples as well as phenotypic measures have been collected. Coverage by year of birth, zygosity determination, ethnic heterogeneity, and influences of in vitro fertilization are also described.",

    "title": "Limited Parallelism in Genetic Adaptation to Brackish Water Bodies in European Sprat and Atlantic Herring.",
    "abstract": "The European sprat is a small plankton-feeding clupeid present in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, in the Mediterranean Sea, and in the brackish Baltic Sea and Black Sea. This species is the target of a major fishery and, therefore, an accurate characterization of its genetic population structure is crucial to delineate proper stock assessments that aid ensuring the fishery's sustainability. Here, we present (i) a draft genome assembly, (ii) pooled whole genome sequencing of 19 population samples covering most of the species' distribution range, and (iii) the design and test of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-chip resource and use this to validate the population structure inferred from pooled sequencing. These approaches revealed, using the populations sampled here, three major groups of European sprat: Oceanic, Coastal, and Brackish with limited differentiation within groups even over wide geographical stretches. Genetic structure is largely driven by six large putative inversions that differentiate Oceanic and Brackish sprats, while Coastal populations display intermediate frequencies of haplotypes at each locus. Interestingly, populations from the Baltic and the Black Seas share similar frequencies of haplotypes at these putative inversions despite their distant geographic location. The closely related clupeids European sprat and Atlantic herring both show genetic adaptation to the brackish Baltic Sea, providing an opportunity to explore the extent of genetic parallelism. This analysis revealed limited parallelism because out of 125 independent loci detected in the Atlantic herring, three showed sharp signals of selection that overlapped between the two species and contained single genes such as PRLRA, which encodes the receptor for prolactin, a freshwater-adapting hormone in euryhaline species, and THRB, a receptor for thyroid hormones, important both for metabolic regulation and the development of red cone photoreceptors.",

    "title": "Towards Bioleaching of a Vanadium Containing Magnetite for Metal Recovery.",
    "abstract": "Vanadium - a transition metal - is found in the ferrous-ferric mineral, magnetite. Vanadium has many industrial applications, such as in the production of high-strength low-alloy steels, and its increasing global industrial consumption requires new primary sources. Bioleaching is a biotechnological process for microbially catalyzed dissolution of minerals and wastes for metal recovery such as biogenic organic acid dissolution of bauxite residues. In this study, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to identify microorganisms in Nordic mining environments influenced by vanadium containing sources. These data identified gene sequences that aligned to the Gluconobacter genus that produce gluconic acid. Several strategies for magnetite dissolution were tested including oxidative and reductive bioleaching by acidophilic microbes along with dissimilatory reduction by Shewanella spp. that did not yield significant metal release. In addition, abiotic dissolution of the magnetite was tested with gluconic and oxalic acids, and yielded 3.99 and 81.31% iron release as a proxy for vanadium release, respectively. As a proof of principle, leaching via gluconic acid production by Gluconobacter oxydans resulted in a maximum yield of 9.8% of the available iron and 3.3% of the vanadium. Addition of an increased concentration of glucose as electron donor for gluconic acid production alone, or in combination with calcium carbonate to buffer the pH, increased the rate of iron dissolution and final vanadium recoveries. These data suggest a strategy of biogenic organic acid mediated vanadium recovery from magnetite and point the way to testing additional microbial species to optimize the recovery.",

    "title": "DNA methylation for subtype classification and prediction of treatment outcome in patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",
    "abstract": "Despite improvements in the prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), subgroups of patients would benefit from alternative treatment approaches. Our aim was to identify genes with DNA methylation profiles that could identify such groups. We determined the methylation levels of 1320 CpG sites in regulatory regions of 416 genes in cells from 401 children diagnosed with ALL. Hierarchical clustering of 300 CpG sites distinguished between T-lineage ALL and B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL and between the main cytogenetic subtypes of BCP ALL. It also stratified patients with high hyperdiploidy and t(12;21) ALL into 2 subgroups with different probability of relapse. By using supervised learning, we constructed multivariate classifiers by external cross-validation procedures. We identified 40 genes that consistently contributed to accurate discrimination between the main subtypes of BCP ALL and gene sets that discriminated between subtypes of ALL and between ALL and controls in pairwise classification analyses. We also identified 20 individual genes with DNA methylation levels that predicted relapse of leukemia. Thus, methylation analysis should be explored as a method to improve stratification of ALL patients. The genes highlighted in our study are not enriched to specific pathways, but the gene expression levels are inversely correlated to the methylation levels.",

    "title": "A relationship between phages and organic carbon in wastewater treatment plant effluents.",
    "abstract": "With stringent effluent requirements and the implementation of new processes for micropollutant removal, it is increasingly important for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to understand the factors affecting effluent quality. Phages (viruses infecting prokaryotes) are abundant in the biological treatment processes. They can contribute to organic carbon in the treated effluent both because they are organic in nature and occur in the effluent and because they cause lysis of microorganisms. Today very little is known about the effects of phages on effluent quality. The goal of this study was, therefore, to determine the relationship between phages and organic carbon in WWTP effluents. We also examined the diversity, taxonomy, and host-association of DNA phages using metagenomics. Effluent samples were collected from four WWTPs treating municipal wastewater. Significant differences in both organic carbon and virus-like particle concentrations were observed between the plants and there was a linear relationship between the two parameters. The phage communities were diverse with many members being taxonomically unclassified. Putative hosts were dominated by bacteria known to be abundant in activated sludge systems such as Comamonadaceae. The composition of phages differed between the WWTPs, suggesting that local conditions shape the communities. Overall, our findings suggest that the abundance and composition of phages are related to effluent quality. Thus, there is a need for further research clarifying the association between phage dynamics and WWTP function.",

    "title": "Niche partitioning between planktivorous fish in the pelagic Baltic Sea assessed by DNA metabarcoding, qPCR and microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Marine communities undergo rapid changes related to human-induced ecosystem pressures. The Baltic Sea pelagic food web has experienced several regime shifts during the past century, resulting in a system where competition between the dominant planktivorous mesopredatory clupeid fish species herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and the rapidly increasing stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) population is assumed to be high. Here, we investigate diet overlap between these three planktivorous fishes in the Baltic Sea, utilizing DNA metabarcoding on the 18S rRNA gene and the COI gene, targeted qPCR, and microscopy. Our results show niche differentiation between clupeids and stickleback, and highlight that rotifers play an important role in this pattern, as a resource that is not being used by the clupeids nor by other zooplankton in spring. We further show that all the diet assessment methods used in this study are consistent, but also that DNA metabarcoding describes the plankton-fish link at the highest taxonomic resolution. This study suggests that rotifers and other understudied soft-bodied prey may have an important function in the pelagic food web and that the growing population of pelagic stickleback may be supported by the open feeding niche offered by the rotifers.",

    "abstract": "Post-acute COVID-19 (PACS) are associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, especially postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Patients with PACS, both in the absence or presence of POTS, exhibit a wide range of persisting symptoms long after the acute infection. Some of these symptoms may stem from alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to provide a broad molecular characterization of patients with PACS with (PACS + POTS) and without (PACS-POTS) POTS compared to healthy subjects, including a broad proteomic characterization with a focus on plasma cardiometabolic proteins, quantification of cytokines/chemokines and determination of plasma sphingolipid levels. Twenty-one healthy subjects without a prior COVID-19 infection (mean age 43 years, 95% females), 20 non-hospitalized patients with PACS + POTS (mean age 39 years, 95% females) and 22 non-hospitalized patients with PACS-POTS (mean age 44 years, 100% females) were studied. PACS patients were non-hospitalized and recruited ≈18 months after the acute infection. Cardiometabolic proteomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of ≈200 out of 700 analyzed proteins in both PACS groups vs. healthy subjects with the majority (> 90%) being upregulated. There was a large overlap (> 90%) with no major differences between the PACS groups. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed alterations in hemostasis/coagulation, metabolism, immune responses, and angiogenesis in PACS vs. healthy controls. Furthermore, 11 out of 33 cytokines/chemokines were significantly upregulated both in PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS vs. healthy controls and none of the cytokines were downregulated. There were no differences in between the PACS groups in the cytokine levels. Lastly, 16 and 19 out of 88 sphingolipids were significantly dysregulated in PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS, respectively, compared to controls with no differences between the groups. Collectively, these observations suggest a clear and distinct dysregulation in the proteome, cytokines/chemokines, and sphingolipid levels in PACS patients compared to healthy subjects without any clear signature associated with POTS. This enhances our understanding and might pave the way for future experimental and clinical investigations to elucidate and/or target resolution of inflammation and micro-clots and restore the hemostasis and immunity in PACS.",

    "title": "Epigenome-wide analysis across the development span of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: backtracking to birth.",
    "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of disease-related mortality in children. Causes of leukemia, the most common form, are largely unknown. Growing evidence points to an origin in-utero, when global redistribution of DNA methylation occurs driving tissue differentiation.\r\n\r\nEpigenome-wide DNA methylation was profiled in surrogate (blood) and target (bone marrow) tissues at birth, diagnosis, remission and relapse of pediatric pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) patients. Double-blinded analyses was performed between prospective cohorts extending from birth to diagnosis and retrospective studies backtracking from clinical disease to birth. Validation was carried out using independent technologies and populations.\r\n\r\nThe imprinted and immuno-modulating VTRNA2-1 was hypermethylated (FDR<0.05) at birth in nested cases relative to controls in all tested populations (totaling 317 cases and 483 controls), including European and Hispanic ancestries. VTRNA2-1 methylation was stable over follow-up years after birth and across surrogate, target and other tissues (n=5,023 tissues; 30 types). When profiled in leukemic tissues from two clinical cohorts (totaling 644 cases), VTRNA2-1 methylation exhibited higher levels at diagnosis relative to controls, it reset back to normal levels at remission, and then re-increased to above control levels at relapse. Hypermethylation was significantly associated with worse pre-B ALL patient survival and with reduced VTRNA2-1 expression (n=2,294 tissues; 26 types), supporting a functional and translational role for VTRNA2-1 methylation.\r\n\r\nThis study provides proof-of-concept to detect at birth epigenetic precursors of pediatric pre-B ALL. These alterations were reproducible with different technologies, in three continents and in two ethnicities, and can offer biomarkers for early detection and prognosis as well as actionable targets for therapy.",

    "title": "The genetic structure of the Swedish population.",
    "abstract": "Patterns of genetic diversity have previously been shown to mirror geography on a global scale and within continents and individual countries. Using genome-wide SNP data on 5174 Swedes with extensive geographical coverage, we analyzed the genetic structure of the Swedish population. We observed strong differences between the far northern counties and the remaining counties. The population of Dalarna county, in north middle Sweden, which borders southern Norway, also appears to differ markedly from other counties, possibly due to this county having more individuals with remote Finnish or Norwegian ancestry than other counties. An analysis of genetic differentiation (based on pairwise F(st)) indicated that the population of Sweden's southernmost counties are genetically closer to the HapMap CEU samples of Northern European ancestry than to the populations of Sweden's northernmost counties. In a comparison of extended homozygous segments, we detected a clear divide between southern and northern Sweden with small differences between the southern counties and considerably more segments in northern Sweden. Both the increased degree of homozygosity in the north and the large genetic differences between the south and the north may have arisen due to a small population in the north and the vast geographical distances between towns and villages in the north, in contrast to the more densely settled southern parts of Sweden. Our findings have implications for future genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with respect to the matching of cases and controls and the need for within-county matching. We have shown that genetic differences within a single country may be substantial, even when viewed on a European scale. Thus, population stratification needs to be accounted for, even within a country like Sweden, which is often perceived to be relatively homogenous and a favourable resource for genetic mapping, otherwise inferences based on genetic data may lead to false conclusions.",

    "title": "CUBN is a gene locus for albuminuria.",
    "abstract": "Identification of genetic risk factors for albuminuria may alter strategies for early prevention of CKD progression, particularly among patients with diabetes. Little is known about the influence of common genetic variants on albuminuria in both general and diabetic populations. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 63,153 individuals of European ancestry with genotype information from genome-wide association studies (CKDGen Consortium) and from a large candidate gene study (CARe Consortium) to identify susceptibility loci for the quantitative trait urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and the clinical diagnosis microalbuminuria. We identified an association between a missense variant (I2984V) in the CUBN gene, which encodes cubilin, and both UACR (P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) and microalbuminuria (P = 0.001). We observed similar associations among 6981 African Americans in the CARe Consortium. The associations between this variant and both UACR and microalbuminuria were significant in individuals of European ancestry regardless of diabetes status. Finally, this variant associated with a 41% increased risk for the development of persistent microalbuminuria during 20 years of follow-up among 1304 participants with type 1 diabetes in the prospective DCCT/EDIC Study. In summary, we identified a missense CUBN variant that associates with levels of albuminuria in both the general population and in individuals with diabetes.",

    "title": "Large-scale gene-centric analysis identifies novel variants for coronary artery disease.",
    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a significant genetic contribution that is incompletely characterized. To complement genome-wide association (GWA) studies, we conducted a large and systematic candidate gene study of CAD susceptibility, including analysis of many uncommon and functional variants. We examined 49,094 genetic variants in ∼2,100 genes of cardiovascular relevance, using a customised gene array in 15,596 CAD cases and 34,992 controls (11,202 cases and 30,733 controls of European descent; 4,394 cases and 4,259 controls of South Asian origin). We attempted to replicate putative novel associations in an additional 17,121 CAD cases and 40,473 controls. Potential mechanisms through which the novel variants could affect CAD risk were explored through association tests with vascular risk factors and gene expression. We confirmed associations of several previously known CAD susceptibility loci (eg, 9p21.3:p<10(-33); LPA:p<10(-19); 1p13.3:p<10(-17)) as well as three recently discovered loci (COL4A1/COL4A2, ZC3HC1, CYP17A1:p<5×10(-7)). However, we found essentially null results for most previously suggested CAD candidate genes. In our replication study of 24 promising common variants, we identified novel associations of variants in or near LIPA, IL5, TRIB1, and ABCG5/ABCG8, with per-allele odds ratios for CAD risk with each of the novel variants ranging from 1.06-1.09. Associations with variants at LIPA, TRIB1, and ABCG5/ABCG8 were supported by gene expression data or effects on lipid levels. Apart from the previously reported variants in LPA, none of the other ∼4,500 low frequency and functional variants showed a strong effect. Associations in South Asians did not differ appreciably from those in Europeans, except for 9p21.3 (per-allele odds ratio: 1.14 versus 1.27 respectively; P for heterogeneity = 0.003). This large-scale gene-centric analysis has identified several novel genes for CAD that relate to diverse biochemical and cellular functions and clarified the literature with regard to many previously suggested genes.",

    "abstract": "The large interactive surfaces of nanoparticles (NPs) increase the opportunities to develop NPs for vascular targeting. Proteomic analysis of endothelial cells exposed to NPs reveals the cellular response and turns the focus into the impairment of the endothelial permeability. Here, quantitative proteomics and transcriptome sequencing are combined to evaluate the effects of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of TiO 2 -USNPs and TiO2 -NPs on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Endothelial cells react to preserve the semi-permeable properties that are essential for vascular tissue fluid homeostasis, vascular development, and angiogenesis. The main impact of the exposure was alteration of functional complexes involved in cell adhesion, vesicular transport, and cytoskeletal structure. Those are the core cellular structures that are linked to the permeability and the integrity of the endothelial tissue. Moreover, the extracellular proteins uptake along wih the NPs into the endothelial cells escape the lysosomal degradation pathway. These findings improve the understanding of the interaction of NPs with endothelial cell. The effects of the studied NPs modulating cell-cell adhesion and vesicular transport can help to evaluate the distribution of NPs via intravenous administration.",

    "title": "Forest Fire Influence on Tomicus piniperda-Associated Fungal Communities and Phloem Nutrient Availability of Colonized Pinus sylvestris.",
    "abstract": "Forest fire is known to positively affect bark beetle populations by providing fire-damaged trees with impaired defenses for infestation. Tomicus piniperda, the common pine shoot beetle, breeds and lays eggs under the bark of stressed pine trees and is considered a serious forest pest within its native range. Wood-colonizing fungi have been hypothesized to improve substrate quality and detoxify tree defensive chemistry to indirectly facilitate tree colonization by beetles. While some bark beetle species form symbiotic associations with fungi and actively vector their partners when colonizing new trees, T. piniperda does not have mycangia or body hairs for specific vectoring of fungi. To explore the T. piniperda-associated fungal community for signs of specific association, we used ITS metabarcoding to separately characterize fungal communities associated with surface and gut of male and female beetles. We also characterized the temporal changes in fungal community and nutrient status of pine phloem with and without beetle galleries. Sampling was performed 2 years after a natural forest fire and included both burnt and unburnt sites. In our study system, we find that forest fire significantly impacts the fungal community composition associated with T. piniperda and that fire may also indirectly change nutrient availability in phloem to beetle galleries. We conclude that T. piniperda can vector fungi to newly colonized trees but the absence of positive effects on substrate quality and minimal effects of sex indicate that vectoring of associated fungal communities is not a strategy associated with the T. piniperda life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is associated with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases in men, and genetic predisposition to LOY is associated with poor poststroke outcome. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that LOY itself is associated with functional outcome after ischemic stroke.\n\nThe study comprised male patients with ischemic stroke from the cohort studies SAHLSIS2 (Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke Phase 2; n=588) and LSR (Lund Stroke Register; n=735). We used binary logistic regression to analyze associations between LOY, determined by DNA microarray intensity data, and poor 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, >2) in each cohort separately and combined. Patients who received recanalization therapy were excluded from sensitivity analyses.\n\nLOY was associated with about 2.5-fold increased risk of poor outcome in univariable analyses (P<0.001). This association withstood separate adjustment for stroke severity and diabetes in both cohorts but not age. In sensitivity analyses restricted to the nonrecanalization group (n=987 in the combined cohort), the association was significant also after separate adjustment for age (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.4]) and when additionally adjusting for stroke severity and diabetes (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.5]).\n\nWe observed an association between LOY and poor outcome after ischemic stroke in patients not receiving recanalization therapy. Future studies on LOY and other somatic genetic alterations in larger stroke cohorts are warranted.",

    "title": "The genome-scale DNA-binding profile of BarR, a β-alanine responsive transcription factor in the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.",
    "abstract": "The Leucine-responsive Regulatory Protein (Lrp) family is a widespread family of regulatory transcription factors in prokaryotes. BarR is an Lrp-like transcription factor in the model archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius that activates the expression of a β-alanine aminotransferase gene, which is involved in β-alanine degradation. In contrast to classical Lrp-like transcription factors, BarR is not responsive to any of the α-amino acids but interacts specifically with β-alanine. Besides the juxtaposed β-alanine aminotransferase gene, other regulatory targets of BarR have not yet been identified although β-alanine is the precursor of coenzyme A and thus an important central metabolite. The aim of this study is to extend the knowledge of the DNA-binding characteristics of BarR and of its corresponding regulon from a local to a genome-wide perspective.\n\nWe characterized the genome-wide binding profile of BarR using chromatin immunoprecipation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). This revealed 21 genomic binding loci. High-enrichment binding regions were validated to interact with purified BarR protein in vitro using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and almost all targets were also shown to harbour a conserved semi-palindromic binding motif. Only a small subset of enriched genomic sites are located in intergenic regions at a relative short distance to a promoter, and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that only one additional operon is under activation of BarR, namely the glutamine synthase operon. The latter is also a target of other Lrp-like transcription factors. Detailed inspection of the BarR ChIP-seq profile at the β-alanine aminotransferase promoter region in combination with binding motif predictions indicate that the operator structure is more complicated than previously anticipated, consisting of multiple (major and auxiliary) operators.\n\nBarR has a limited regulon, and includes also glutamine synthase genes besides the previously characterized β-alanine aminotransferase. Regulation of glutamine synthase is suggestive of a link between β-alanine and α-amino acid metabolism in S. acidocaldarius. Furthermore, this work reveals that the BarR regulon overlaps with that of other Lrp-like regulators.",

    "title": "Fam83F induces p53 stabilisation and promotes its activity.",
    "abstract": "p53 is one of the most important tumour suppressor proteins currently known. It is activated in response to DNA damage and this activation leads to proliferation arrest and cell death. The abundance and activity of p53 are tightly controlled and reductions in p53's activity can contribute to the development of cancer. Here, we show that Fam83F increases p53 protein levels by protein stabilisation. Fam83F interacts with p53 and decreases its ubiquitination and degradation. Fam83F is induced in response to DNA damage and its overexpression also increases p53 activity in cell culture experiments and in zebrafish embryos. Downregulation of Fam83F decreases transcription of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage and increases cell proliferation, identifying Fam83F as an important regulator of the DNA damage response. Overexpression of Fam83F also enhances migration of cells harbouring mutant p53 demonstrating that it can also activate mutant forms of p53.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial receptivity is crucial for implantation and establishment of a normal pregnancy. The shift from proliferative to receptive endometrium is still far from being understood. In this paper, we comprehensively present the transcriptome of the human endometrium by comparing endometrial biopsies from proliferative phase with consecutive biopsies 7-9 days after ovulation. The results show a clear difference in expression between the two time points using both total and small RNA sequencing. A total of 3,297 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 516 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 102 small noncoding RNAs were identified as statistically differentially expressed between the two time points. We show a thorough description of the change in mRNA between the two time points and display lncRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, and small nuclear RNAs not previously reported in the healthy human endometrium. In conclusion, this paper reports in detail the shift in RNA expression from the proliferative to receptive endometrium.",

    "title": "Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche.",
    "abstract": "Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.",
