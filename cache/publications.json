    "title": "The Genetic Architecture of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Contribution of Liability to OCD From Alleles Across the Frequency Spectrum.",
    "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is known to be substantially heritable; however, the contribution of genetic variation across the allele frequency spectrum to this heritability remains uncertain. The authors used two new homogeneous cohorts to estimate the heritability of OCD from inherited genetic variation and contrasted the results with those of previous studies.\n\nThe sample consisted of 2,090 Swedish-born individuals diagnosed with OCD and 4,567 control subjects, all genotyped for common genetic variants, specifically >400,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥0.01. Using genotypes of these SNPs to estimate distant familial relationships among individuals, the authors estimated the heritability of OCD, both overall and partitioned according to MAF bins.\n\nNarrow-sense heritability of OCD was estimated at 29% (SE=4%). The estimate was robust, varying only modestly under different models. Contrary to an earlier study, however, SNPs with MAF between 0.01 and 0.05 accounted for 10% of heritability, and estimated heritability per MAF bin roughly followed expectations based on a simple model for SNP-based heritability.\n\nThese results indicate that common inherited risk variation (MAF ≥0.01) accounts for most of the heritable variation in OCD. SNPs with low MAF contribute meaningfully to the heritability of OCD, and the results are consistent with expectation under the \"infinitesimal model\" (also referred to as the \"polygenic model\"), where risk is influenced by a large number of loci across the genome and across MAF bins.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) gene cause localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis. We report six consanguineous families from Pakistan with segregating hypotrichosis localized to the scalp. Genetic investigation using polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed homozygosity spanning the LAH3 locus on chromosome 13 in affected individuals of all six families. Sequence analysis of the LPAR6 gene showed a novel insertion resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination (p.I194FfsX11) in affected members of one family. In the remaining five families we identified a previously described missense mutation (p.G146R) in a homozygous state in affected members. The closest flanking polymorphic marker showed an identical allele size in the five families segregating with the p.G146R mutation, supporting a single origin of this variation. These findings extend the spectrum of known LPAR6 mutations and suggest a founder effect of the p.G146R mutation in the Pakistani population.",

    "title": "Early Pleistocene origin and extensive intra-species diversity of the extinct cave lion.",
    "abstract": "The cave lion is an extinct felid that was widespread across the Holarctic throughout the Late Pleistocene. Its closest extant relative is the lion (Panthera leo), but the timing of the divergence between these two taxa, as well as their taxonomic ranking are contentious. In this study we analyse 31 mitochondrial genome sequences from cave lion individuals that, through a combination of 14C and genetic tip dating, are estimated to be from dates extending well into the mid-Pleistocene. We identified two deeply diverged and well-supported reciprocally monophyletic mitogenome clades in the cave lion, and an additional third distinct lineage represented by a single individual. One of these clades was restricted to Beringia while the other was prevalent across western Eurasia. These observed clade distributions are in line with previous observations that Beringian and European cave lions were morphologically distinct. The divergence dates for these lineages are estimated to be far older than those between extant lions subspecies. By combining our radiocarbon tip-dates with a split time prior that takes into account the most up-to-date fossil stem calibrations, we estimated the mitochondrial DNA divergence between cave lions and lions to be 1.85 Million ya (95% 0.52- 2.91 Mya). Taken together, these results support previous hypotheses that cave lions existed as at least two subspecies during the Pleistocene, and that lions and cave lions were distinct species.",

    "title": "Massive functional mapping of a 5'-UTR by saturation mutagenesis, phenotypic sorting and deep sequencing.",
    "abstract": "We present here a method that enables functional screening of large number of mutations in a single experiment through the combination of random mutagenesis, phenotypic cell sorting and high-throughput sequencing. As a test case, we studied post-transcriptional gene regulation of the bacterial csgD messenger RNA, which is regulated by a small RNA (sRNA). A 109 bp sequence within the csgD 5'-UTR, containing all elements for expression and sRNA-dependent control, was mutagenized close to saturation. We monitored expression from a translational gfp fusion and collected fractions of cells with distinct expression levels by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Deep sequencing of mutant plasmids from cells in different activity-sorted fractions identified functionally important positions in the messenger RNA that impact on intrinsic (translational activity per se) and extrinsic (sRNA-based) gene regulation. The results obtained corroborate previously published data. In addition to pinpointing nucleotide positions that change expression levels, our approach also reveals mutations that are silent in terms of gene expression and/or regulation. This method provides a simple and informative tool for studies of regulatory sequences in RNA, in particular addressing RNA structure-function relationships (e.g. sRNA-mediated control, riboswitch elements). However, slight protocol modifications also permit mapping of functional DNA elements and functionally important regions in proteins.",

    "title": "Detecting DNA Methylations in the Hyperthermoacidophilic Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius Using SMRT Sequencing.",
    "abstract": "DNA methylations are one of the most well-known epigenetic modifications along with histone modifications and noncoding RNAs. They are found at specific sites along the DNA in all domains of life, with 5-mC and 6-mA/4-mC being well-characterized in eukaryotes and bacteria respectively, and they have not only been described as contributing to the structure of the double helix itself but also as regulators of DNA-based processes such as replication, transcription, and recombination. Different methods have been developed to accurately identify and/or map methylated motifs to decipher the involvement of DNA methylations in regulatory networks that affect the cellular state.Although DNA methylations have been detected along archaeal genomes, their involvement as regulators of DNA-based processes remains the least known. To highlight the importance of DNA methylations in the control of key cellular mechanisms and their dynamics in archaea cells, we have used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. This sequencing technology allows the identification and direct mapping of the methylated motifs along the genome of an organism. In this chapter, we present a step-by-step protocol for detecting DNA methylations in the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius using SMRT sequencing. This protocol can easily be adapted to other prokaryotes.",

    "title": "The combined effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, tobacco products, and ethanol on normal resting blood mononuclear cells.",
    "abstract": "Tobacco and ethanol consumption are crucial factors in the development of various diseases including cancer. In this investigation, we evaluated the combined effects of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with ethanol and tobacco products on healthy individuals.\r\n\r\nPure nicotine, cigarette smoke extract, and Swedish snuff (snus) extract were used. The effects were examined by means of in vitro cell cycle progression and cell death of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors.\r\n\r\nAfter 3 days, in vitro, resting PBMCs entered the S and G2 stage in the presence of 100 µM nicotine. The PBMCs only proceeded to S stage, in the presence of 0.2% ethanol. The nicotine- and ethanol-induced normal cell cycle progression correlated to a number of SNPs in the IL12RB2, Rad 52, XRCC2, P53, CCND3, and ABCA1 genes. Certain SNPs in Caspases 8, IL12RB2, Rad 52, MMP2, and MDM2 genes appeared to significantly influence the effects of EtOH-, snus-, and snus + EtOH-induced cell death. Importantly, the highest degree of cell death was observed in the presence of smoke + EtOH. The amount of cell death under this treatment condition also correlated to specific SNPs, located in the MDM2, ABCA1, or GASC1 genes.\r\n\r\nCigarette smoke in combination with ethanol strongly induced massive cell death. Long-term exposure to smoke and ethanol could provoke chronic inflammation, and this could be the initiation of disease including the development of cancer at various sites.",

    "abstract": "Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol are heritable, modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined 188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research.",

    "title": "Genome wide association identifies common variants at the SERPINA6/SERPINA1 locus influencing plasma cortisol and corticosteroid binding globulin.",
    "abstract": "Variation in plasma levels of cortisol, an essential hormone in the stress response, is associated in population-based studies with cardio-metabolic, inflammatory and neuro-cognitive traits and diseases. Heritability of plasma cortisol is estimated at 30-60% but no common genetic contribution has been identified. The CORtisol NETwork (CORNET) consortium undertook genome wide association meta-analysis for plasma cortisol in 12,597 Caucasian participants, replicated in 2,795 participants. The results indicate that <1% of variance in plasma cortisol is accounted for by genetic variation in a single region of chromosome 14. This locus spans SERPINA6, encoding corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG, the major cortisol-binding protein in plasma), and SERPINA1, encoding α1-antitrypsin (which inhibits cleavage of the reactive centre loop that releases cortisol from CBG). Three partially independent signals were identified within the region, represented by common SNPs; detailed biochemical investigation in a nested sub-cohort showed all these SNPs were associated with variation in total cortisol binding activity in plasma, but some variants influenced total CBG concentrations while the top hit (rs12589136) influenced the immunoreactivity of the reactive centre loop of CBG. Exome chip and 1000 Genomes imputation analysis of this locus in the CROATIA-Korcula cohort identified missense mutations in SERPINA6 and SERPINA1 that did not account for the effects of common variants. These findings reveal a novel common genetic source of variation in binding of cortisol by CBG, and reinforce the key role of CBG in determining plasma cortisol levels. In turn this genetic variation may contribute to cortisol-associated degenerative diseases.",

    "title": "Harmonization of Neuroticism and Extraversion phenotypes across inventories and cohorts in the Genetics of Personality Consortium: an application of Item Response Theory.",
    "abstract": "Mega- or meta-analytic studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies) are increasingly used in behavior genetics. An issue in such studies is that phenotypes are often measured by different instruments across study cohorts, requiring harmonization of measures so that more powerful fixed effect meta-analyses can be employed. Within the Genetics of Personality Consortium, we demonstrate for two clinically relevant personality traits, Neuroticism and Extraversion, how Item-Response Theory (IRT) can be applied to map item data from different inventories to the same underlying constructs. Personality item data were analyzed in >160,000 individuals from 23 cohorts across Europe, USA and Australia in which Neuroticism and Extraversion were assessed by nine different personality inventories. Results showed that harmonization was very successful for most personality inventories and moderately successful for some. Neuroticism and Extraversion inventories were largely measurement invariant across cohorts, in particular when comparing cohorts from countries where the same language is spoken. The IRT-based scores for Neuroticism and Extraversion were heritable (48 and 49 %, respectively, based on a meta-analysis of six twin cohorts, total N = 29,496 and 29,501 twin pairs, respectively) with a significant part of the heritability due to non-additive genetic factors. For Extraversion, these genetic factors qualitatively differ across sexes. We showed that our IRT method can lead to a large increase in sample size and therefore statistical power. The IRT approach may be applied to any mega- or meta-analytic study in which item-based behavioral measures need to be harmonized.",

    "abstract": "The onset and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) involves a cascade of genetic and/or epigenetic events. The aim of the present study was to address the DNA methylation status of genes relevant in colorectal carcinogenesis and its progression, such as genes frequently mutated in CRC, genes involved in the DNA repair and Wnt signaling pathway.\n\nWe analyzed methylation status in totally 160 genes in 12 paired colorectal tumors and adjacent healthy mucosal tissues using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip.\n\nWe found significantly aberrant methylation in 23 genes (NEIL1, NEIL3, DCLRE1C, NHEJ1, GTF2H5, CCNH, CTNNB1, DKK2, DKK3, FZD5 LRP5, TLE3, WNT2, WNT3A, WNT6, TCF7L1, CASP8, EDNRB1, GPC6, KIAA1804, MYO1B, SMAD2 and TTN). External validation by mRNA expression showed a good agreement between hypermethylation in cancer and down-regulated mRNA expression of the genes EDNRB1, GPC6 and SMAD2, and between hypomethylation and up-regulated mRNA expression of the CASP8 and DCLRE1C genes.\n\nAberrant methylation of the DCLRE1C and GPC6 genes are presented here for the first time and are therefore of special interest for further validation as novel candidate biomarker genes in CRC, and merit further validation with specific assays.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. We therefore sought to study DNA sequence variation and serum levels of the potent inflammatory mediators Interleukin-6 (IL6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in relation to AD and dementia. Tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were chosen to capture most variation in and around CRP and IL6 in 3937 elderly Swedish men and women (1,265 AD cases). A sub-set of the population (n = 723) with serum measurements of CRP and IL6 was included in 1) a nested case-control study of incident dementia cases, and 2) a case-control study of prevalent dementia cases. None of the SNPs or haplotypes was significantly associated with AD or dementia after correcting for multiple testing nor were elevated baseline levels of hsCRP or IL6 (measured on average 4.3 years before dementia onset) significantly associated with risk of future AD or dementia. However, prevalent AD cases had higher levels of IL6 (measured on average 5.5 years after dementia onset) than age- and gender-matched controls, OR 2.24 (95% CI 1.27-3.95), p-value 0.006. In summary, this data suggests that AD patients have an altered immune profile with higher circulating levels of IL6 than age- and gender-matched controls. However, neither variation in the CRP and IL6 genes nor circulating levels of their respective protein products were associated with an increased risk of developing late-life dementias.",

We demonstrate enrichment of RUNT family transcription-factor-binding motifs in human epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ TRM cells, paralleled by high RUNX2 and RUNX3 protein expression. Sequencing of paired skin and blood samples revealed clonal overlap between epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ TRM cells and circulating memory CD8+CD45RA-CD62L+ T cells. In vitro stimulation of circulating CD8+CD45RA-CD62L+ T cells with IL-15 and TGF-β induced CD49a expression and cytotoxic transcriptional profiles in a RUNX2- and RUNX3-dependent manner. We therefore identified a reservoir of circulating cells with cytotoxic TRM potential. In melanoma patients, high RUNX2, but not RUNX3, transcription correlated with a cytotoxic CD8+CD103+CD49a+ TRM cell signature and improved patient survival. Together, our results indicate that combined RUNX2 and RUNX3 activity promotes the differentiation of cytotoxic CD8+CD103+CD49a+ TRM cells, providing immunosurveillance of infected and malignant cells.",

    "abstract": "Smaller hippocampal volume has repeatedly been reported in schizophrenia patients. Obstetric complications (OCs) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in schizophrenia susceptibility genes have independently been related to hippocampal volume. We investigated putative independent and interaction effects of severe hypoxia-related OCs and variation in four hypoxia-regulated schizophrenia susceptibility genes (BDNF, DTNBP1, GRM3 and NRG1) on hippocampal volume in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.\n\nClinical assessment, structural MRI scans, and blood samples for genotyping of 32 SNPs were obtained from 54 schizophrenia patients and 53 control subjects. Information on obstetric complications was collected from original birth records.\n\nSevere OCs were related to hippocampal volume in both patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects. Of the 32 SNPs studied, effects of severe OCs on hippocampal volume were associated with allele variation in GRM3 rs13242038, but the interaction effect was not specific for schizophrenia. SNP variation in any of the four investigated genes alone did not significantly affect hippocampal volume.\n\nThe findings suggest a gene-environment (G x E) interaction between GRM3 gene variants and severe obstetric complications on hippocampus volume, independent of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Due to the modest sample size, the results must be considered preliminary and require replication in independent samples.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the health benefits of lifelong exercise in humans, we conduct global skeletal muscle transcriptomic analyses of long-term endurance- (9 men, 9 women) and strength-trained (7 men) humans compared with age-matched untrained controls (7 men, 8 women). Transcriptomic analysis, Gene Ontology, and genome-scale metabolic modeling demonstrate changes in pathways related to the prevention of metabolic diseases, particularly with endurance training. Our data also show prominent sex differences between controls and that these differences are reduced with endurance training. Additionally, we compare our data with studies examining muscle gene expression before and after a months-long training period in individuals with metabolic diseases. This analysis reveals that training shifts gene expression in individuals with impaired metabolism to become more similar to our endurance-trained group. Overall, our data provide an extensive examination of the accumulated transcriptional changes that occur with decades-long training and identify important \"exercise-responsive\" genes that could attenuate metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "A high proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or a high ratio of MUFAs to saturated fatty acids in plasma, reflecting a high activity of the lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), has been shown to be related to cancer death and incidence in some studies.\n\nThe objective was to study whether the serum cholesteryl ester proportion of palmitoleic acid [16:1n-7 (16:1ω-3)] and the ratio of palmitoleic to palmitic acid (16:1n-7/16:0), as an estimation of the activity of SCD-1, are related to cancer death and to investigate whether polymorphisms in the SCD-1 gene are related to cancer mortality.\n\nA community-based cohort of 50-y-old men was followed for a maximum of >40 y. Survival analysis was used to relate fatty acid composition in serum, analyzed at baseline by gas-liquid chromatography (n = 1981), and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SCD-1 gene (n = 986) to cancer death. A 7-d dietary record was completed at age 70 y (n = 880).\n\nThe proportions of 16:1n-7 and the ratio of 16:1n-7 to 16:0 were associated with cancer mortality during follow-up in a comparison of the highest with the lowest quartile of 16:1n-7 (adjusted HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.82). Inherited variance of the SCD-1 gene seemed to be related to cancer death, especially among men with a low proportion of PUFA in the diet in a comparison of the highest with the lowest weighted genetic risk score (HR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.04).\n\nThe findings are compatible with the hypothesis that there is an association between endogenously synthesized MUFAs and cancer death.",

    "abstract": "Endomyocardial biopsy is a valuable tool in cardiac diagnostics but is limited by low diagnostic yield and significant complication risks. Meanwhile, recent developments in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies promise a wealth of biological data from minimal tissue samples. To take advantage of the minimal tissue amount needed for molecular analyses, we have developed a sub-millimeter endovascular biopsy device, considerably smaller than current clinical equipment, and devised a low-input RNA-sequencing protocol for analyzing small tissue samples. In in vivo evaluation in swine, 81% of biopsy attempts (n = 157) were successful. High quality RNA-sequencing data was generated from 91% of the sequenced cardiac micro-biopsy samples (n = 32). Gene expression signatures of samples taken with the novel device were comparable with a conventional device. No major complications were detected either during procedures or during 7 days' follow-up, despite acquiring a relatively large number of biopsies (median 30) in each animal. In conclusion, the novel device coupled with RNA-sequencing provides a feasible method to obtain molecular data from the myocardium. The method is less traumatic and has a higher flexibility compared to conventional methods, enabling safer and more targeted sampling from different parts of the myocardium.",

    "title": "Novel cancer gene discovery using a forward genetic screen in RCAS-PDGFB-driven gliomas.",
    "abstract": "Malignant gliomas, the most common malignant brain tumors in adults, represent a heterogeneous group of diseases with poor prognosis. Retroviruses can cause permanent genetic alterations that modify genes close to the viral integration site.\n\nHere we describe the use of a high-throughput pipeline coupled to the commonly used tissue-specific retroviral RCAS-TVA mouse tumor model system. Utilizing next-generation sequencing, we show that retroviral integration sites can be reproducibly detected in malignant stem cell lines generated from RCAS-PDGFB-driven glioma biopsies.\n\nA large fraction of common integration sites contained genes that have been dysregulated or misexpressed in glioma. Others overlapped with loci identified in previous glioma-related forward genetic screens, but several novel putative cancer-causing genes were also found. Integrating retroviral tagging and clinical data, Ppfibp1 was highlighted as a frequently tagged novel glioma-causing gene. Retroviral integrations into the locus resulted in Ppfibp1 upregulation, and Ppfibp1-tagged cells generated tumors with shorter latency on orthotopic transplantation. In human gliomas, increased PPFIBP1 expression was significantly linked to poor prognosis and PDGF treatment resistance.\n\nAltogether, the current study has demonstrated a novel approach to tagging glioma genes via forward genetics, validating previous results, and identifying PPFIBP1 as a putative oncogene in gliomagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the functional effect of genetic variation is critical for clinical genome interpretation. We systematically characterized the transcriptome effects of protein-truncating variants, a class of variants expected to have profound effects on gene function, using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and Geuvadis projects. We quantitated tissue-specific and positional effects on nonsense-mediated transcript decay and present an improved predictive model for this decay. We directly measured the effect of variants both proximal and distal to splice junctions. Furthermore, we found that robustness to heterozygous gene inactivation is not due to dosage compensation. Our results illustrate the value of transcriptome data in the functional interpretation of genetic variants.",

    "title": "Old but not (so) degenerated--slow evolution of largely homomorphic sex chromosomes in ratites.",
    "abstract": "Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027-0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110-157 and ending 24-30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise d(N)/d(S) between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific d(N)/d(S) was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.",

    "abstract": "Combining 3D cultures such as tumor spheroids and organoids with spatial omics holds great potential for tissue biology and cancer research. Yet, this potential is presently limited by technical and financial challenges of spatial omics methods and 3D cultures. To address this, we combine dye diffusion, the Smart-seq3xpress protocol for deep single-cell gene expression profiling, and dedicated probabilistic inference methods into diffusion Smart-seq3 (Smart-seq3D), to reveal the transcriptome of single cells along with their position along the core-periphery axis of spheroids. Applying Smart-seq3D to triple-negative breast tumor spheroids identifies thousands of spatial genes and reveals continuous, ungated spatial gene expression. Spatial gene and pathway expression patterns suggest biologies specific to spheroid regions, which we validate by immunostainings and pharmacological interventions. We use the Smart-seq3D data to test evolutionary principles of spatial tumor heterogeneity. Finally, we characterize aspects of tumor heterogeneity captured by 3D spheroids that are missing from 2D cultures but found in tumors in vivo. Smart-seq3D can offer a cost-efficient approach to explore how cells adapt their transcriptome to different micro-environments, reveal spatial determinants of drug resistance and could serve to characterize spatial interactions between cancer and stromal/immune cells in 3D co-cultures.",

    "title": "Systematic investigation of contribution of genetic variation in the HLA-DP region to cervical cancer susceptibility.",
    "abstract": "Compared with the other human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, few studies have evaluated the role of HLA-DP genes in cervical cancer pathogenesis. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Swedish population has identified a susceptibility locus for cervical cancer within the HLA-DP region. To further study this locus, we imputed classic HLA alleles using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and analysed 449 genotyped and 3066 imputed SNPs in 1034 cervical cancer patients and 3948 controls. We confirmed that the strongest signal came from a SNP located at HLA-DPB2 [rs3117027, odds ratio (OR) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.43, P = 1.9 × 10(-6) for A allele] and that this effect is not driven by associations with classic HLA alleles. In silico analysis further revealed that this SNP is highly correlated with rs3129294 (D' = 1, r(2) = 0.95 in controls), which may have a putative regulatory function. We also identified an independent association at DPB1*0402, which conferred decreased risk of cervical cancer (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63-0.89, P = 7.0 × 10(-4)) and is independent of previously described associations with HLA-B*0702, DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602, and DRB1*1301-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0603. No association was found with the two SNPs (rs4282438 or rs9277952) that were recently identified within the HLA-DP region in a cervical cancer GWAS in the Chinese population. Our study provides the first systematic investigation of the association of genetic variants in the HLA-DP region with cervical cancer susceptibility and provides further insight into the contribution of polymorphisms in the HLA-DP region to risk of cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "The human genome contains thousands of potentially coding short open reading frames (sORFs). While a growing set of microproteins translated from these sORFs have been demonstrated to mediate important cellular functions, the majority remains uncharacterized. In our study, we performed a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out screen targeting 11,776 sORFs to identify microproteins essential for cancer cell line growth. We show that the CENPBD2P gene encodes a translated sORF and promotes cell fitness. We selected five additional candidate sORFs encoding microproteins between 11 and 63 amino acids in length for further functional assessment. Green fluorescent protein fusion constructs of these microproteins localized to distinct subcellular compartments, and the majority showed reproducible biochemical interaction partners. Studying the fitness and transcriptome of sORF knock-outs and complementation with the corresponding microprotein, we identify rescuable phenotypes while also illustrating the limitations and caveats of our pipeline for sORF functional screening and characterization.",

    "title": "Genetic Architectures of Childhood- and Adult-Onset Asthma Are Partly Distinct.",
    "abstract": "The extent to which genetic risk factors are shared between childhood-onset (COA) and adult-onset (AOA) asthma has not been estimated. On the basis of data from the UK Biobank study (n = 447,628), we found that the variance in disease liability explained by common variants is higher for COA (onset at ages between 0 and 19 years; h 2g = 25.6%) than for AOA (onset at ages between 20 and 60 years; h2g = 10.6%). The genetic correlation (rg) between COA and AOA was 0.67. Variation in age of onset among COA-affected individuals had a low heritability (h2g = 5%), which we confirmed in independent studies and also among AOA-affected individuals. To identify subtype-specific genetic associations, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the UK Biobank for COA (13,962 affected individuals) and a separate GWAS for AOA (26,582 affected individuals) by using a common set of 300,671 controls for both studies. We identified 123 independent associations for COA and 56 for AOA (37 overlapped); of these, 98 and 34, respectively, were reproducible in an independent study (n = 262,767). Collectively, 28 associations were not previously reported. For 96 COA-associated variants, including five variants that represent COA-specific risk factors, the risk allele was more common in COA- than in AOA-affected individuals. Conversely, we identified three variants that are stronger risk factors for AOA. Variants associated with obesity and smoking had a stronger contribution to the risk of AOA than to the risk of COA. Lastly, we identified 109 likely target genes of the associated variants, primarily on the basis of correlated expression quantitative trait loci (up to n = 31,684). GWAS informed by age of onset can identify subtype-specific risk variants, which can help us understand differences in pathophysiology between COA and AOA and so can be informative for drug development.",

    "title": "Common variants at 10 genomic loci influence hemoglobin A₁(C) levels via glycemic and nonglycemic pathways.",
    "abstract": "Glycated hemoglobin (HbA₁(c)), used to monitor and diagnose diabetes, is influenced by average glycemia over a 2- to 3-month period. Genetic factors affecting expression, turnover, and abnormal glycation of hemoglobin could also be associated with increased levels of HbA₁(c). We aimed to identify such genetic factors and investigate the extent to which they influence diabetes classification based on HbA₁(c) levels.\n\nWe studied associations with HbA₁(c) in up to 46,368 nondiabetic adults of European descent from 23 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 8 cohorts with de novo genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We combined studies using inverse-variance meta-analysis and tested mediation by glycemia using conditional analyses. We estimated the global effect of HbA₁(c) loci using a multilocus risk score, and used net reclassification to estimate genetic effects on diabetes screening.\n\nTen loci reached genome-wide significant association with HbA(1c), including six new loci near FN3K (lead SNP/P value, rs1046896/P = 1.6 × 10⁻²⁶), HFE (rs1800562/P = 2.6 × 10⁻²⁰), TMPRSS6 (rs855791/P = 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁴), ANK1 (rs4737009/P = 6.1 × 10⁻¹²), SPTA1 (rs2779116/P = 2.8 × 10⁻⁹) and ATP11A/TUBGCP3 (rs7998202/P = 5.2 × 10⁻⁹), and four known HbA₁(c) loci: HK1 (rs16926246/P = 3.1 × 10⁻⁵⁴), MTNR1B (rs1387153/P = 4.0 × 10⁻¹¹), GCK (rs1799884/P = 1.5 × 10⁻²⁰) and G6PC2/ABCB11 (rs552976/P = 8.2 × 10⁻¹⁸). We show that associations with HbA₁(c) are partly a function of hyperglycemia associated with 3 of the 10 loci (GCK, G6PC2 and MTNR1B). The seven nonglycemic loci accounted for a 0.19 (% HbA₁(c)) difference between the extreme 10% tails of the risk score, and would reclassify ∼2% of a general white population screened for diabetes with HbA₁(c).\n\nGWAS identified 10 genetic loci reproducibly associated with HbA₁(c). Six are novel and seven map to loci where rarer variants cause hereditary anemias and iron storage disorders. Common variants at these loci likely influence HbA₁(c) levels via erythrocyte biology, and confer a small but detectable reclassification of diabetes diagnosis by HbA₁(c).",

    "title": "The HLA locus contains novel foetal susceptibility alleles for congenital heart block with significant paternal influence.",
    "abstract": "The main aim of this study was to identify foetal susceptibility genes on chromosome six for Ro/SSA autoantibody-mediated congenital heart block.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of individuals in the Swedish Congenital Heart Block (CHB) study population was performed. Low-resolution HLA-A, -Cw and -DRB1 allele typing was carried out in 86 families comprising 339 individuals (86 Ro/SSA autoantibody-positive mothers, 71 fathers, 87 CHB index cases and 95 unaffected siblings).\n\nA case-control comparison between index cases and population-based out-of-study controls (n = 1710) revealed association of CHB with 15 SNPs in the 6p21.3 MHC locus at a chromosome-wide significance of P < 2.59 × 10(-6) (OR 2.21-3.12). In a family-based analysis of association of SNP markers as well as distinct MHC class I and II alleles with CHB, HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-Cw*05 variants were significantly more frequently transmitted to affected individuals (P < 0.03 and P < 0.05, respectively), whilst HLA-DRB1*13 and HLA-Cw*06 variants were significantly less often transmitted to affected children (P < 0.04 and P < 0.03). We further observed marked association of increased paternal (but not maternal) HLA-DRB1*04 transmission to affected offspring (P < 0.02).\n\nHLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-Cw*05 were identified as novel foetal HLA allele variants that confer susceptibility to CHB in response to Ro/SSA autoantibody exposure, whilst DRB1*13 and Cw*06 emerged as protective alleles. Additionally, we demonstrated a paternal contribution to foetal susceptibility to CHB for the first time.",

    "title": "Unveiling distribution patterns of freshwater phytoplankton by a next generation sequencing based approach.",
    "abstract": "The recognition and discrimination of phytoplankton species is one of the foundations of freshwater biodiversity research and environmental monitoring. This step is frequently a bottleneck in the analytical chain from sampling to data analysis and subsequent environmental status evaluation. Here we present phytoplankton diversity data from 49 lakes including three seasonal surveys assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S ribosomal RNA chloroplast and cyanobacterial gene amplicons and also compare part of these datasets with identification based on morphology. Direct comparison of NGS to microscopic data from three time-series showed that NGS was able to capture the seasonality in phytoplankton succession as observed by microscopy. Still, the PCR-based approach was only semi-quantitative, and detailed NGS and microscopy taxa lists had only low taxonomic correspondence. This is probably due to, both, methodological constraints and current discrepancies in taxonomic frameworks. Discrepancies included Euglenophyta and Heterokonta that were scarce in the NGS but frequently detected by microscopy and Cyanobacteria that were in general more abundant and classified with high resolution by NGS. A deep-branching taxonomically unclassified cluster was frequently detected by NGS but could not be linked to any group identified by microscopy. NGS derived phytoplankton composition differed significantly among lakes with different trophic status, showing that our approach can resolve phytoplankton communities at a level relevant for ecosystem management. The high reproducibility and potential for standardization and parallelization makes our NGS approach an excellent candidate for simultaneous monitoring of prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton in inland waters.",

    "title": "Associations between the Bacterial Composition of Farm Bulk Milk and the Microbiota in the Resulting Swedish Long-Ripened Cheese.",
    "abstract": "The maturation of a traditional Swedish long-ripened cheese has shown increasing variation in recent years and the ripening time is now generally longer than in the past. While the cheese is reliant on non-starter lactic acid bacteria for the development of its characteristic flavour, we hypothesised that the observed changes could be due to variations in the microbiota composition and number of bacteria in the raw milk used for production of the cheese. To evaluate associations between microbiota in the raw milk and the resulting cheese, three clusters of commercial farms were created to increase variation in the microbiota of dairy silo milk used for cheese production. Cheese production was performed in three periods over one year. Within each period, milk from the three farm clusters was collected separately and transported to the cheese production facility. Following pasteurisation, the milk was processed into the granular-eyed cheese and matured at a dedicated cheese-ripening facility. For each cheese batch, farm bulk and dairy silo milk samples, a starter culture, early process samples and cheese samples from different stages of maturation (7-20 months) were collected and their microbiota characterised using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The microbiota in the farm bulk milk differed significantly between periods and clusters. Differences in microbiota in dairy silo milk were observed between periods, but not between farm clusters, while the cheese microbiota differed between periods and clusters. The top 13 amplicon sequence variants were dominant in early process samples and the resulting cheese, making up at least 93.3% of the relative abundance (RA). Lactococcus was the dominant genus in the early process samples and, together with Leuconostoc, also dominated in the cheese samples. Contradicting expectations, the RA of the aroma-producing genus Lactobacillus was low in cheese during ripening and there was an unexpected dominance of starter lactic acid bacteria even at the later stages of cheese ripening. To identify factors behind the recent variations in ripening time of this cheese, future studies should address the effects of process variables and the dairy environment.",

    "title": "The interleukin-6 receptor as a target for prevention of coronary heart disease: a mendelian randomisation analysis.",
    "abstract": "A high circulating concentration of interleukin 6 is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Blockade of the interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) with a monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) licensed for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis reduces systemic and articular inflammation. However, whether IL6R blockade also reduces risk of coronary heart disease is unknown.\n\nApplying the mendelian randomisation principle, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene IL6R to evaluate the likely efficacy and safety of IL6R inhibition for primary prevention of coronary heart disease. We compared genetic findings with the effects of tocilizumab reported in randomised trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn 40 studies including up to 133,449 individuals, an IL6R SNP (rs7529229) marking a non-synonymous IL6R variant (rs8192284; p.Asp358Ala) was associated with increased circulating log interleukin-6 concentration (increase per allele 9·45%, 95% CI 8·34-10·57) as well as reduced C-reactive protein (decrease per allele 8·35%, 95% CI 7·31-9·38) and fibrinogen concentrations (decrease per allele 0·85%, 95% CI 0·60-1·10). This pattern of effects was consistent with IL6R blockade from infusions of tocilizumab (4-8 mg/kg every 4 weeks) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis studied in randomised trials. In 25,458 coronary heart disease cases and 100,740 controls, the IL6R rs7529229 SNP was associated with a decreased odds of coronary heart disease events (per allele odds ratio 0·95, 95% CI 0·93-0·97, p=1·53×10(-5)).\n\nOn the basis of genetic evidence in human beings, IL6R signalling seems to have a causal role in development of coronary heart disease. IL6R blockade could provide a novel therapeutic approach to prevention of coronary heart disease that warrants testing in suitably powered randomised trials. Genetic studies in populations could be used more widely to help to validate and prioritise novel drug targets or to repurpose existing agents and targets for new therapeutic uses.\n\nUK Medical Research Council; British Heart Foundation; Rosetrees Trust; US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Du Pont Pharma; Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland; Wellcome Trust; Coronary Thrombosis Trust; Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research; UCLH/UCL Comprehensive Medical Research Centre; US National Institute on Aging; Academy of Finland; Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development; SANCO; Dutch Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sports; World Cancer Research Fund; Agentschap NL; European Commission; Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation; Swedish Research Council; Strategic Cardiovascular Programme of the Karolinska Institutet; Stockholm County Council; US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; MedStar Health Research Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; Dutch Kidney Foundation; US National Institutes of Health; Netherlands Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands; Diabetes UK; European Union Seventh Framework Programme; National Institute for Healthy Ageing; Cancer Research UK; MacArthur Foundation.",

    "abstract": "B cell function and autoantibodies are important in SLE pathogenesis. In this work, we aimed to investigate the impact of cumulative SLE B cell genetics on SLE subphenotype and autoantibody profile.\n\nFemale patients with SLE (n=1248) and healthy controls (n=400) were genotyped using Illumina's Global Screening Array. Two polygenic risk scores (PRSs), one representing B cell genes and the other B cell activation genes, were calculated for each individual using risk loci for SLE in genes assigned to B cell-related pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology and Reactome Databases.\n\nDouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies were more prevalent among patients with a high compared with a low SLE B cell PRS (OR 1.47 (1.07 to 2.01), p=0.018), and effect sizes were augmented in patients with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) risk haplotypes HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 (DRB1*03/15 -/- (OR 0.99 (0.56 to 1.77), p=0.98; DRB1*03/15 +/- or -/+ (OR 1.64 (1.06 to 2.54), p=0.028; and DRB1*03/15 +/+ (OR 4.47 (1.21 to 16.47), p=0.024). Further, a high compared with a low B cell PRS was associated with low complement levels in DRB1*03/15 +/+ patients (OR 3.92 (1.22 to 12.64), p=0.022). The prevalence of lupus nephritis (LN) was higher in patients with a B cell activation PRS above the third quartile compared with patients below (OR 1.32 (1.00 to 1.74), p=0.048).\n\nHigh genetic burden related to B cell function is associated with dsDNA antibody development and LN. Assessing B cell PRSs may be important in order to determine immunological pathways influencing SLE and to predict clinical phenotype.",

    "title": "Absence of oxygen effect on microbial structure and methane production during drying and rewetting events.",
    "abstract": "Natural environments with frequent drainage experience drying and rewetting events that impose fluctuations in water availability and oxygen exposure. These relatively dramatic cycles profoundly impact microbial activity in the environment and subsequent emissions of methane and carbon dioxide. In this study, we mimicked drying and rewetting events by submitting methanogenic communities from strictly anaerobic environments (anaerobic digestors) with different phylogenetic structures to consecutive desiccation events under aerobic (air) and anaerobic (nitrogen) conditions followed by rewetting. We showed that methane production quickly recovered after each rewetting, and surprisingly, no significant difference was observed between the effects of the aerobic or anaerobic desiccation events. There was a slight change in the microbial community structure and a decrease in methane production rates after consecutive drying and rewetting, which can be attributed to a depletion of the pool of available organic matter or the inhibition of the methanogenic communities. These observations indicate that in comparison to the drying and rewetting events or oxygen exposure, the initial phylogenetic structure and the organic matter quantity and quality exhibited a stronger influence on the methanogenic communities and overall microbial community responses. These results change the current paradigm of the sensitivity of strict anaerobic microorganisms to oxygen exposure.",

    "title": "ZBED6 regulates Igf2 expression partially through its regulation of miR483 expression.",
    "abstract": "The expression of Igf2 in mammals shows a complex regulation involving multiple promoters and epigenetic mechanisms. We previously identified a novel regulatory mechanism based on the interaction between the transcriptional factor ZBED6 and Igf2 intron. Disruption of the ZBED6-Igf2 interaction leads to a dramatic up-regulation of IGF2 expression postnatally. In the current study we characterize an additional layer of regulation involving miR483 encoded by another Igf2 intron. We found a highly significant up-regulation of miR483 expression when the ZBED6-Igf2 axis is disrupted in transgenic mice. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock-out of miR483 in C2C12 myoblast cells, both wild-type and cells with disrupted ZBED6-Igf2 axis (Igf2dGGCT), resulted in down-regulation of Igf2 expression and a reduced proliferation rate. This was further validated using miR483 mimics and inhibitors. RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway among genes down-regulated in miR483-/- cells, including Igf2 down-regulation. The opposite pattern was observed in Igf2dGGCT cells, where Igf2 is up-regulated. Our data suggest a positive feedback between miR483 and Igf2 promoter activity, strongly affecting how ZBED6 controls Igf2 expression in various cell types.",

    "title": "Species-specific dynamics may cause deviations from general biogeographical predictions - evidence from a population genomics study of a New Guinean endemic passerine bird family (Melampittidae).",
    "abstract": "The family Melampittidae is endemic to New Guinea and consists of two monotypic genera: Melampitta lugubris (Lesser Melampitta) and Megalampitta gigantea (Greater Melampitta). Both Melampitta species have scattered and disconnected distributions across New Guinea in the central mountain range and in some of the outlying ranges. While M. lugubris is common and found in most montane regions of the island, M. gigantaea is elusive and known from only six localities in isolated pockets on New Guinea with very specific habitats of limestone and sinkholes. In this project, we apply museomics to determine the population structure and demographic history of these two species. We re-sequenced the genomes of all seven known M. gigantaea samples housed in museum collections as well as 24 M. lugubris samples from across its distribution. By comparing population structure between the two species, we investigate to what extent habitat dependence, such as in M. gigantaea, may affect population connectivity. Phylogenetic and population genomic analyses, as well as acoustic variation revealed that M. gigantaea consists of a single population in contrast to M. lugubris that shows much stronger population structure across the island. We suggest a recent collapse of M. gigantaea into its fragmented habitats as an explanation to its unexpected low diversity and lack of population structure. The deep genetic divergences between the M. lugubris populations on the Vogelkop region, in the western central range and the eastern central range, respectively, suggests that these three populations should be elevated to full species level. This work sheds new light on the mechanisms that have shaped the intriguing distribution of the two species within this family and is a prime example of the importance of museum collections for genomic studies of poorly known and rare species.",

    "title": "Trans-ethnic Fine Mapping Highlights Kidney-Function Genes Linked to Salt Sensitivity.",
    "abstract": "We analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWASs), including data from 71,638 individuals from four ancestries, for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function used to define chronic kidney disease (CKD). We identified 20 loci attaining genome-wide-significant evidence of association (p < 5 × 10(-8)) with kidney function and highlighted that allelic effects on eGFR at lead SNPs are homogeneous across ancestries. We leveraged differences in the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between diverse populations to fine-map the 20 loci through construction of \"credible sets\" of variants driving eGFR association signals. Credible variants at the 20 eGFR loci were enriched for DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) in human kidney cells. DHS credible variants were expression quantitative trait loci for NFATC1 and RGS14 (at the SLC34A1 locus) in multiple tissues. Loss-of-function mutations in ancestral orthologs of both genes in Drosophila melanogaster were associated with altered sensitivity to salt stress. Renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 in a salt-sensitive mouse model was also reduced after exposure to a high-salt diet or induced CKD. Our study (1) demonstrates the utility of trans-ethnic fine mapping through integration of GWASs involving diverse populations with genomic annotation from relevant tissues to define molecular mechanisms by which association signals exert their effect and (2) suggests that salt sensitivity might be an important marker for biological processes that affect kidney function and CKD in humans.",

    "title": "Transplant experiments uncover Baltic Sea basin-specific responses in bacterioplankton community composition and metabolic activities.",
    "abstract": "Anthropogenically induced changes in precipitation are projected to generate increased river runoff to semi-enclosed seas, increasing loads of terrestrial dissolved organic matter and decreasing salinity. To determine how bacterial community structure and functioning adjust to such changes, we designed microcosm transplant experiments with Baltic Proper (salinity 7.2) and Bothnian Sea (salinity 3.6) water. Baltic Proper bacteria generally reached higher abundances than Bothnian Sea bacteria in both Baltic Proper and Bothnian Sea water, indicating higher adaptability. Moreover, Baltic Proper bacteria growing in Bothnian Sea water consistently showed highest bacterial production and beta-glucosidase activity. These metabolic responses were accompanied by basin-specific changes in bacterial community structure. For example, Baltic Proper Pseudomonas and Limnobacter populations increased markedly in relative abundance in Bothnian Sea water, indicating a replacement effect. In contrast, Roseobacter and Rheinheimera populations were stable or increased in abundance when challenged by either of the waters, indicating an adjustment effect. Transplants to Bothnian Sea water triggered the initial emergence of particular Burkholderiaceae populations, and transplants to Baltic Proper water triggered Alteromonadaceae populations. Notably, in the subsequent re-transplant experiment, a priming effect resulted in further increases to dominance of these populations. Correlated changes in community composition and metabolic activity were observed only in the transplant experiment and only at relatively high phylogenetic resolution. This suggested an importance of successional progression for interpreting relationships between bacterial community composition and functioning. We infer that priming effects on bacterial community structure by natural episodic events or climate change induced forcing could translate into long-term changes in bacterial ecosystem process rates.",

    "title": "Interactions of dietary whole-grain intake with fasting glucose- and insulin-related genetic loci in individuals of European descent: a meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies.",
    "abstract": "Whole-grain foods are touted for multiple health benefits, including enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing type 2 diabetes risk. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in individuals free of diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that whole-grain food intake and genetic variation interact to influence concentrations of fasting glucose and insulin.\n\nVia meta-analysis of data from 14 cohorts comprising ∼ 48,000 participants of European descent, we studied interactions of whole-grain intake with loci previously associated in GWAS with fasting glucose (16 loci) and/or insulin (2 loci) concentrations. For tests of interaction, we considered a P value <0.0028 (0.05 of 18 tests) as statistically significant.\n\nGreater whole-grain food intake was associated with lower fasting glucose and insulin concentrations independent of demographics, other dietary and lifestyle factors, and BMI (β [95% CI] per 1-serving-greater whole-grain intake: -0.009 mmol/l glucose [-0.013 to -0.005], P < 0.0001 and -0.011 pmol/l [ln] insulin [-0.015 to -0.007], P = 0.0003). No interactions met our multiple testing-adjusted statistical significance threshold. The strongest SNP interaction with whole-grain intake was rs780094 (GCKR) for fasting insulin (P = 0.006), where greater whole-grain intake was associated with a smaller reduction in fasting insulin concentrations in those with the insulin-raising allele.\n\nOur results support the favorable association of whole-grain intake with fasting glucose and insulin and suggest a potential interaction between variation in GCKR and whole-grain intake in influencing fasting insulin concentrations.",

    "title": "Iron age genomic data from Althiburos - Tunisia renew the debate on the origins of African taurine cattle.",
    "abstract": "The Maghreb is a key region for understanding the dynamics of cattle dispersal and admixture with local aurochs following their earliest domestication in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Here, we present data on autosomal genomes and mitogenomes obtained for four archaeological specimens of Iron Age (∼2,800 cal BP-2,000 cal BP) domestic cattle from the Eastern Maghreb, i.e. Althiburos (El Kef, Tunisia). D-loop sequences were obtained for an additional eight cattle specimens from this site. Maternal lineages were assigned to the elusive R and ubiquitous African-T1 haplogroups found in two and ten Althiburos specimens, respectively. Our results can be explained by post-domestication hybridization of Althiburos cattle with local aurochs. However, we cannot rule out an independent domestication in North Africa considering the shared ancestry of Althiburos cattle with the pre-domestic Moroccan aurochs and present-day African taurine cattle.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplasts are essential organelles in plants and eukaryotic algae, responsible for photosynthesis, fatty acid synthesis, amino acid production, and stress responses. The genus Passiflora, known for its species diversity and dynamic chloroplast (cp) genome evolution, serves as an excellent model for studying structural variations. This study investigates evolutionary relationships within Passiflora by sequencing 11 new chloroplast genomes, assessing selective pressures on cp genes, and comparing plastid and nuclear phylogenies. Passiflora cp genomes showed significant variations in size, gene content, and structure, ranging from 132,736 to 163,292 base pairs, especially in Decaloba. Structural rearrangements and species-specific repeat patterns were identified. Selective pressure tests revealed significant adaptive evolution in certain lineages, with several genes, including clpP and petL, under positive selection. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the monophyly of subgenera Astrophea, Passiflora, and Decaloba, while Deidamioides appeared polyphyletic. Nuclear phylogenetic analysis based on 35S rDNA sequences supported the monophyly of Astrophea but showed inconsistencies within subgenus Passiflora compared to cp genome data. This study highlights the evolutionary complexity of Passiflora cp genomes, demonstrating significant structural variations and adaptive evolution. The findings underscore the effectiveness of plastid phylogenomics in resolving phylogenetic relationships and provide insights into adaptive mechanisms shaping cp genome diversity in angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "A perimetastatic capsule is a strong positive prognostic factor in liver metastases, but its origin remains unclear. Here, we systematically quantify the capsule's extent and cellular composition in 263 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases to investigate its clinical significance and origin. We show that survival improves proportionally with increasing encapsulation and decreasing tumor-hepatocyte contact. Immunostaining reveals the gradual zonation of the capsule, transitioning from benign-like NGFRhigh stroma at the liver edge to FAPhigh stroma towards the tumor. Encapsulation correlates with decreased tumor viability and preoperative chemotherapy. In mice, chemotherapy and tumor cell ablation induce capsule formation. Our results suggest that encapsulation develops where tumor invasion into the liver plates stalls, representing a reparative process rather than tumor-induced desmoplasia. We propose a model of metastases growth, where the efficient tumor colonization of the liver parenchyma and a reparative liver injury reaction are opposing determinants of metastasis aggressiveness.",

    "title": "Forest Fire Influence on Tomicus piniperda-Associated Fungal Communities and Phloem Nutrient Availability of Colonized Pinus sylvestris.",
    "abstract": "Forest fire is known to positively affect bark beetle populations by providing fire-damaged trees with impaired defenses for infestation. Tomicus piniperda, the common pine shoot beetle, breeds and lays eggs under the bark of stressed pine trees and is considered a serious forest pest within its native range. Wood-colonizing fungi have been hypothesized to improve substrate quality and detoxify tree defensive chemistry to indirectly facilitate tree colonization by beetles. While some bark beetle species form symbiotic associations with fungi and actively vector their partners when colonizing new trees, T. piniperda does not have mycangia or body hairs for specific vectoring of fungi. To explore the T. piniperda-associated fungal community for signs of specific association, we used ITS metabarcoding to separately characterize fungal communities associated with surface and gut of male and female beetles. We also characterized the temporal changes in fungal community and nutrient status of pine phloem with and without beetle galleries. Sampling was performed 2 years after a natural forest fire and included both burnt and unburnt sites. In our study system, we find that forest fire significantly impacts the fungal community composition associated with T. piniperda and that fire may also indirectly change nutrient availability in phloem to beetle galleries. We conclude that T. piniperda can vector fungi to newly colonized trees but the absence of positive effects on substrate quality and minimal effects of sex indicate that vectoring of associated fungal communities is not a strategy associated with the T. piniperda life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Insects have been key players in the assessments of biodiversity impacts of anthropogenically driven environmental change, including the evolutionary and ecological impacts of climate change. Populations of Edith's Checkerspot Butterfly (Euphydryas editha) adapt rapidly to diverse environmental conditions, with numerous high-impact studies documenting these dynamics over several decades. However, studies of the underlying genetic bases of these responses have been hampered by missing genomic resources, limiting the ability to connect genomic responses to environmental change. Using a combination of Oxford Nanopore long reads, haplotype merging, HiC scaffolding followed by Illumina polishing, we generated a highly contiguous and complete assembly (contigs n = 142, N50 = 21.2 Mb, total length = 607.8 Mb; BUSCOs n = 5,286, single copy complete = 97.8%, duplicated = 0.9%, fragmented = 0.3%, missing = 1.0%). A total of 98% of the assembled genome was placed into 31 chromosomes, which displayed large-scale synteny with other well-characterized lepidopteran genomes. The E. editha genome, annotation, and functional descriptions now fill a missing gap for one of the leading field-based ecological model systems in North America.",

    "title": "Molecular architecture of the developing mouse brain.",
    "abstract": "The mammalian brain develops through a complex interplay of spatial cues generated by diffusible morphogens, cell-cell interactions and intrinsic genetic programs that result in probably more than a thousand distinct cell types. A complete understanding of this process requires a systematic characterization of cell states over the entire spatiotemporal range of brain development. The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1-8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.",

    "title": "A national long-read sequencing study on chromosomal rearrangements uncovers hidden complexities.",
    "abstract": "Clinical genetic laboratories often require a comprehensive analysis of chromosomal rearrangements/structural variants (SVs), from large events like translocations and inversions to supernumerary ring/marker chromosomes and small deletions or duplications. Understanding the complexity of these events and their clinical consequences requires pinpointing breakpoint junctions and resolving the derivative chromosome structure. This task often surpasses the capabilities of short-read sequencing technologies. In contrast, long-read sequencing techniques present a compelling alternative for clinical diagnostics. Here, Genomic Medicine Sweden-Rare Diseases has explored the utility of HiFi Revio long-read genome sequencing (lrGS) for digital karyotyping of SVs nationwide. The 16 samples from 13 families were collected from all Swedish healthcare regions. Prior investigations had identified 16 SVs, ranging from simple to complex rearrangements, including inversions, translocations, and copy number variants. We have established a national pipeline and a shared variant database for variant calling and filtering. Using lrGS, 14 of the 16 known SVs are detected. Of these, 13 are mapped at nucleotide resolution, and one complex rearrangement is only visible by read depth. Two Chromosome 21 rearrangements, one mosaic, remain undetected. Average read lengths are 8.3-18.8 kb with coverage exceeding 20× for all samples. De novo assembly results in a limited number of phased contigs per individual (N50 6-86 Mb), enabling direct characterization of the chromosomal rearrangements. In a national pilot study, we demonstrate the utility of HiFi Revio lrGS for analyzing chromosomal rearrangements. Based on our results, we propose a 5-year plan to expand lrGS use for rare disease diagnostics in Sweden.",

    "title": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with a variant in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality and has a significant heritability. We carried out a genome-wide association discovery study of 1866 patients with AAA and 5435 controls and replication of promising signals (lead SNP with a p value < 1 × 10(-5)) in 2871 additional cases and 32,687 controls and performed further follow-up in 1491 AAA and 11,060 controls. In the discovery study, nine loci demonstrated association with AAA (p < 1 × 10(-5)). In the replication sample, the lead SNP at one of these loci, rs1466535, located within intron 1 of low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) demonstrated significant association (p = 0.0042). We confirmed the association of rs1466535 and AAA in our follow-up study (p = 0.035). In a combined analysis (6228 AAA and 49182 controls), rs1466535 had a consistent effect size and direction in all sample sets (combined p = 4.52 × 10(-10), odds ratio 1.15 [1.10-1.21]). No associations were seen for either rs1466535 or the 12q13.3 locus in independent association studies of coronary artery disease, blood pressure, diabetes, or hyperlipidaemia, suggesting that this locus is specific to AAA. Gene-expression studies demonstrated a trend toward increased LRP1 expression for the rs1466535 CC genotype in arterial tissues; there was a significant (p = 0.029) 1.19-fold (1.04-1.36) increase in LRP1 expression in CC homozygotes compared to TT homozygotes in aortic adventitia. Functional studies demonstrated that rs1466535 might alter a SREBP-1 binding site and influence enhancer activity at the locus. In conclusion, this study has identified a biologically plausible genetic variant associated specifically with AAA, and we suggest that this variant has a possible functional role in LRP1 expression.",
