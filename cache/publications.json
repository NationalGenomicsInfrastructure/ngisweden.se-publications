    "title": "Neuronal Expression of Opioid Gene is Controlled by Dual Epigenetic and Transcriptional Mechanism in Human Brain.",
    "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms that define patterns of neuropeptide expression are essential for the formation and rewiring of neural circuits. The prodynorphin gene (PDYN) gives rise to dynorphin opioid peptides mediating depression and substance dependence. We here demonstrated that PDYN is expressed in neurons in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and identified neuronal differentially methylated region in PDYN locus framed by CCCTC-binding factor binding sites. A short, nucleosome size human-specific promoter CpG island (CGI), a core of this region may serve as a regulatory module, which is hypomethylated in neurons, enriched in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and targeted by USF2, a methylation-sensitive E-box transcription factor (TF). USF2 activates PDYN transcription in model systems, and binds to nonmethylated CGI in dlPFC. USF2 and PDYN expression is correlated, and USF2 and PDYN proteins are co-localized in dlPFC. Segregation of activatory TF and repressive CGI methylation may ensure contrasting PDYN expression in neurons and glia in human brain.",

    "title": "Evolutionary consequences of genomic deletions and insertions in the woolly mammoth genome.",
    "abstract": "Woolly mammoths had a set of adaptations that enabled them to thrive in the Arctic environment. Many mammoth-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for unique mammoth traits have been previously identified from ancient genomes. However, a multitude of other genetic variants likely contributed to woolly mammoth evolution. In this study, we sequenced two woolly mammoth genomes and combined these with previously sequenced mammoth and elephant genomes to conduct a survey of mammoth-specific deletions and indels. We find that deletions are highly enriched in non-coding regions, suggesting selection against structural variants that affect protein sequences. Nonetheless, at least 87 woolly mammoth genes contain deletions or indels that modify the coding sequence, including genes involved in skeletal morphology and hair growth. These results suggest that deletions and indels contributed to the unique phenotypic adaptations of the woolly mammoth, and were potentially critical to surviving in its natural environment.",

    "title": "Middle Pleistocene genome calibrates a revised evolutionary history of extinct cave bears.",
    "abstract": "Palaeogenomes provide the potential to study evolutionary processes in real time, but this potential is limited by our ability to recover genetic data over extended timescales.1 As a consequence, most studies so far have focused on samples of Late Pleistocene or Holocene age, which covers only a small part of the history of many clades and species. Here, we report the recovery of a low coverage palaeogenome from the petrous bone of a ∼360,000 year old cave bear from Kudaro 1 cave in the Caucasus Mountains. Analysis of this genome alongside those of several Late Pleistocene cave bears reveals widespread mito-nuclear discordance in this group. Using the time interval between Middle and Late Pleistocene cave bear genomes, we directly estimate ursid nuclear and mitochondrial substitution rates to calibrate their respective phylogenies. This reveals post-divergence mitochondrial transfer as the dominant factor explaining their mito-nuclear discordance. Interestingly, these transfer events were not accompanied by large-scale nuclear introgression. However, we do detect additional instances of nuclear admixture among other cave bear lineages, and between cave bears and brown bears, which are not associated with mitochondrial exchange. Genomic data obtained from the Middle Pleistocene cave bear petrous bone has thus facilitated a revised evolutionary history of this extinct megafaunal group. Moreover, it suggests that petrous bones may provide a means of extending both the magnitude and time depth of palaeogenome retrieval over substantial portions of the evolutionary histories of many mammalian clades.",

Secondary growth of the stem entails developmental cascades resulting in the formation of secondary phloem outwards and secondary xylem (i.e., wood) inwards of the stem. Signaling and transcriptional reprogramming by the phytohormone ethylene modifies cambial growth and cell differentiation, but the molecular link between ethylene and secondary growth remains unknown.

    "abstract": "Sterile inflammation after injury is important for tissue restoration. In injured human and mouse tissues, macrophages were recently found to accumulate perivascularly. This study investigates if macrophages adopt a mural cell phenotype important for restoration after ischemic injury. Single-cell RNA sequencing of fate-mapped macrophages from ischemic mouse muscles demonstrates a macrophage-toward-mural cell switch of a subpopulation of macrophages with downregulated myeloid cell genes and upregulated mural cell genes, including PDGFRβ. This observation was further strengthened when including unspliced transcripts in the analysis. The macrophage switch was proven functionally relevant, as induction of macrophage-specific PDGFRβ deficiency prevented their perivascular macrophage phenotype, impaired vessel maturation and increased vessel leakiness, which ultimately reduced limb function. In conclusion, macrophages in adult ischemic tissue were demonstrated to undergo a cellular program to morphologically, transcriptomically and functionally resemble mural cells while weakening their macrophage identity. The macrophage-to-mural cell-like phenotypic switch is crucial for restoring tissue function and warrants further exploration as a potential target for immunotherapies to enhance healing.",

    "abstract": "Pdgfra+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) arise in distinct specification waves during embryogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS). It is unclear whether there is a correlation between these waves and different oligodendrocyte (OL) states at adult stages. Here, we present bulk and single-cell transcriptomics resources providing insights on how transitions between these states occur. We found that post-natal OPCs from brain and spinal cord present similar transcriptional signatures. Moreover, post-natal OPC progeny of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells present electrophysiological and transcriptional profiles similar to OPCs derived from subsequent specification waves, indicating that Pdgfra+ pre-OPCs rewire their transcriptional network during development. Single-cell RNA-seq and lineage tracing indicates that a subset of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells originates cells of the pericyte lineage. Thus, our results indicate that embryonic Pdgfra+ cells in the CNS give rise to distinct post-natal cell lineages, including OPCs with convergent transcriptional profiles in different CNS regions.",

    "title": "A Novel Inorganic Sulfur Compound Metabolizing Ferroplasma-Like Population Is Suggested to Mediate Extracellular Electron Transfer.",
    "abstract": "Mining and processing of metal sulfide ores produces waters containing metals and inorganic sulfur compounds such as tetrathionate and thiosulfate. If released untreated, these sulfur compounds can be oxidized to generate highly acidic wastewaters [termed 'acid mine drainage (AMD)'] that cause severe environmental pollution. One potential method to remediate mining wastewaters is the maturing biotechnology of 'microbial fuel cells' that offers the sustainable removal of acid generating inorganic sulfur compounds alongside producing an electrical current. Microbial fuel cells exploit the ability of bacterial cells to transfer electrons to a mineral as the terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration by replacing the mineral with a solid anode. In consequence, by substituting natural minerals with electrodes, microbial fuel cells also provide an excellent platform to understand environmental microbe-mineral interactions that are fundamental to element cycling. Previously, tetrathionate degradation coupled to the generation of an electrical current has been demonstrated and here we report a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbial community. Reconstruction of inorganic sulfur compound metabolism suggested the substrate tetrathionate was metabolized by the \r\n            Ferroplasma-like and Acidithiobacillus-like populations via multiple pathways. Characterized Ferroplasma species do not utilize inorganic sulfur compounds, suggesting a novel Ferroplasma-like population had been selected. Oxidation of intermediate sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and adenylyl-sulfate released electrons and the extracellular electron transfer to the anode was suggested to be dominated by candidate soluble electron shuttles produced by the Ferroplasma-like population. However, as the soluble electron shuttle compounds also have alternative functions within the cell, it cannot be ruled out that acidophiles use novel, uncharacterized mechanisms to mediate extracellular electron transfer. Several populations within the community were suggested to metabolize intermediate inorganic sulfur compounds by multiple pathways, which highlights the potential for mutualistic or symbiotic relationships. This study provided the genetic base for acidophilic microbial fuel cells utilized for the remediation of inorganic sulfur compounds from AMD.",

    "abstract": "Many endangered species have experienced severe population declines within the last centuries [1, 2]. However, despite concerns about negative fitness effects resulting from increased genetic drift and inbreeding, there is a lack of empirical data on genomic changes in conjunction with such declines [3-7]. Here, we use whole genomes recovered from century-old historical museum specimens to quantify the genomic consequences of small population size in the critically endangered Grauer's and endangered mountain gorillas. We find a reduction of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding and genetic load in the Grauer's gorilla, which experienced severe population declines in recent decades. In contrast, the small but relatively stable mountain gorilla population has experienced little genomic change during the last century. These results suggest that species histories as well as the rate of demographic change may influence how population declines affect genome diversity.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ependymal cells display neural stem cell properties in vitro and generate scar-forming astrocytes and remyelinating oligodendrocytes after injury. We report that ependymal cells are functionally heterogeneous and identify a small subpopulation (8% of ependymal cells and 0.1% of all cells in a spinal cord segment), which we denote ependymal A (EpA) cells, that accounts for the in vitro stem cell potential in the adult spinal cord. After spinal cord injury, EpA cells undergo self-renewing cell division as they give rise to differentiated progeny. Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed a loss of ependymal cell gene expression programs as EpA cells gained signaling entropy and dedifferentiated to a stem-cell-like transcriptional state after an injury. We conclude that EpA cells are highly differentiated cells that can revert to a stem cell state and constitute a therapeutic target for spinal cord repair.",

We report that inhibiting the generation of progeny by a subclass of pericytes led to decreased fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition after spinal cord injury in mice. Regeneration of raphespinal and corticospinal tract axons was enhanced and sensorimotor function recovery improved following spinal cord injury in animals with attenuated pericyte-derived scarring. Using optogenetic stimulation, we demonstrate that regenerated corticospinal tract axons integrated into the local spinal cord circuitry below the lesion site. The number of regenerated axons correlated with improved sensorimotor function recovery. In conclusion, attenuation of pericyte-derived fibrosis represents a promising therapeutic approach to facilitate recovery following CNS injury.",

    "title": "Schwann cell precursors represent a neural crest-like state with biased multipotency.",
    "abstract": "Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) are nerve-associated progenitors that can generate myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells but also are multipotent like the neural crest cells from which they originate. SCPs are omnipresent along outgrowing peripheral nerves throughout the body of vertebrate embryos. By using single-cell transcriptomics to generate a gene expression atlas of the entire neural crest lineage, we show that early SCPs and late migratory crest cells have similar transcriptional profiles characterised by a multipotent \"hub\" state containing cells biased towards traditional neural crest fates. SCPs keep diverging from the neural crest after being primed towards terminal Schwann cells and other fates, with different subtypes residing in distinct anatomical locations. Functional experiments using CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function further show that knockout of the common \"hub\" gene Sox8 causes defects in neural crest-derived cells along peripheral nerves by facilitating differentiation of SCPs towards sympathoadrenal fates. Finally, specific tumour populations found in melanoma, neurofibroma and neuroblastoma map to different stages of SCP/Schwann cell development. Overall, SCPs resemble migrating neural crest cells that maintain multipotency and become transcriptionally primed towards distinct lineages.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic germline variants in \r\n                ETV6 have been associated with familial predisposition to thrombocytopenia and hematological malignancies, predominantly childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). In addition, overrepresentation of a high hyperdiploid subtype and older age at diagnosis have been reported among sporadic BCP-ALL cases with germline variants in ETV6 We studied a family with 2 second-degree relatives who developed childhood high hyperdiploid BCP-ALL at ages 8 and 12 years, respectively. A constitutional balanced reciprocal translocation t(12;14)(p13.2;q23.1) was discovered in both patients by routine karyotyping at diagnosis and, subsequently, in 7 healthy family members who had not experienced hematological malignancies. No carriers had thrombocytopenia. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the translocation, resulting in 2 actively transcribed but nonfunctional fusion genes, causing heterozygous loss and consequently monoallelic expression of ETV6 Whole-genome sequencing analysis of the affected female subjects' leukemia excluded additional somatic aberrations in ETV6 and RTN1 as well as shared somatic variants in other genes. Expression studies, performed to confirm decreased expression of ETV6, were not conclusive. We suggest that germline aberrations resulting in monoallelic expression of ETV6 contribute to leukemia susceptibility, whereas more severe functional deficiency of ETV6 is required for developing THC5. To our knowledge, this report is the first of a constitutional translocation disrupting ETV6 causing predisposition to childhood ALL.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial tissues, such as the skin, rely on cellular plasticity of stem cells (SCs) from different niches to restore tissue function after injury. How these molecularly and functionally diverse SC populations respond to injury remains elusive. Here, we genetically labeled Lgr5- or Lgr6-expressing cells from the hair follicle bulge and interfollicular epidermis (IFE), respectively, and monitored their individual transcriptional adaptations during wound healing using single-cell transcriptomics. Both Lgr5 and Lgr6 progeny rapidly induced a genetic wound signature that, for Lgr5 progeny, included the remodeling of receptors to permit interactions with the wound environment, a property that Lgr6 progeny possessed even before wounding. When contributing to re-epithelialization, Lgr5 progeny gradually replaced their bulge identity with an IFE identity, and this process started already before Lgr5 progeny left the bulge. Altogether, this study reveals how different SCs respond and adapt to a new environment, potentially explaining cellular plasticity of many epithelial tissues.",

    "title": "Molecular and spatial landmarks of early mouse skin development.",
    "abstract": "A wealth of specialized cell populations within the skin facilitates its hair-producing, protective, sensory, and thermoregulatory functions. How the vast cell-type diversity and tissue architecture develops is largely unexplored. Here, with single-cell transcriptomics, spatial cell-type assignment, and cell-lineage tracing, we deconstruct early embryonic mouse skin during the key transitions from seemingly uniform developmental precursor states to a multilayered, multilineage epithelium, and complex dermal identity. We identify the spatiotemporal emergence of hair-follicle-inducing, muscle-supportive, and fascia-forming fibroblasts. We also demonstrate the formation of the panniculus carnosus muscle (PCM), sprouting blood vessels without pericyte coverage, and the earliest residence of mast and dendritic immune cells in skin. Finally, we identify an unexpected epithelial heterogeneity within the early single-layered epidermis and a signaling-rich periderm layer. Overall, this cellular and molecular blueprint of early skin development-which can be explored at https://kasperlab.org/tools-establishes histological landmarks and highlights unprecedented dynamic interactions among skin cells.",

    "title": "The super-pangenome of Populus unveils genomic facets for its adaptation and diversification in widespread forest trees.",
    "abstract": "Understanding the underlying mechanisms and links between genome evolution and adaptive innovations stands as a key goal in evolutionary studies. Poplars, among the world's most widely distributed and cultivated trees, exhibit extensive phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a genus-level super-pangenome comprising 19 Populus genomes, revealing the likely pivotal role of private genes in facilitating local environmental and climate adaptation. Through the integration of pangenomes with transcriptomes, methylomes, and chromatin accessibility mapping, we unveil that the evolutionary trajectories of pangenes and duplicated genes are closely linked to local genomic landscapes of regulatory and epigenetic architectures, notably CG methylation in gene-body regions. Further comparative genomic analyses have enabled the identification of 142 202 structural variants across species that intersect with a significant number of genes and contribute substantially to both phenotypic and adaptive divergence. We have experimentally validated a ∼180-bp presence/absence variant affecting the expression of the CUC2 gene, crucial for leaf serration formation. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web-based tool encompassing the multi-omics resources associated with the Populus super-pangenome (http://www.populus-superpangenome.com). Together, the present pioneering super-pangenome resource in forest trees not only aids in the advancement of breeding efforts of this globally important tree genus but also offers valuable insights into potential avenues for comprehending tree biology.",

    "title": "Impact of genetic risk loci for multiple sclerosis on expression of proximal genes in patients.",
    "abstract": "Despite advancements in genetic studies, it is difficult to understand and characterize the functional relevance of disease-associated genetic variants, especially in the context of a complex multifactorial disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS). As a large proportion of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are context-specific, we performed RNA-Seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients (n = 145) to identify eQTLs in regions centered on 109 MS risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and 7 associated human leukocyte antigen variants. We identified 77 statistically significant eQTL associations, including pseudogenes and non-coding RNAs. Thirty-eight out of 40 testable eQTL effects were colocalized with the disease association signal. As many eQTLs are tissue specific, we aimed to detail their significance in different cell types. Approximately 70% of the eQTLs were replicated and characterized in at least one major peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived cell type. Furthermore, 40% of eQTLs were found to be more pronounced in MS patients compared with non-inflammatory neurological diseases patients. In addition, we found two single nucleotide polymorphisms to be significantly associated with the proportions of three different cell types. Mapping to enhancer histone marks and predicted transcription factor binding sites added additional functional evidence for eight eQTL regions. As an example, we found that rs71624119, shared with three other autoimmune diseases and located in a primed enhancer (H3K4me1) with potential binding for STAT transcription factors, significantly associates with ANKRD55 expression. This study provides many novel and validated targets for future functional characterization of MS and other diseases.",

Interactions between motor neurons and glia contribute to motor neuron loss, but the spatiotemporal ordering of molecular events that drive these processes in intact spinal tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to obtain gene expression measurements of mouse spinal cords over the course of disease, as well as of postmortem tissue from ALS patients, to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms in ALS. We identify pathway dynamics, distinguish regional differences between microglia and astrocyte populations at early time points, and discern perturbations in several transcriptional pathways shared between murine models of ALS and human postmortem spinal cords.",

    "title": "Activating FGFR1 Mutations in Sporadic Pheochromocytomas.",
    "abstract": "Pheochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumors of the adrenal glands. Up to 40% of the cases are caused by germline mutations in one of at least 15 susceptibility genes, making them the human neoplasms with the highest degree of heritability. Recurrent somatic alterations are found in about 50% of the more common sporadic tumors with NF1 being the most common mutated gene (20-25%). In many sporadic tumors, however, a genetic explanation is still lacking.\n\nWe investigated the genomic landscape of sporadic pheochromocytomas with whole-exome sequencing of 16 paired tumor and normal DNA samples and extended confirmation analysis in 2 additional cohorts comprising a total of 80 sporadic pheochromocytomas.\n\nWe discovered on average 33 non-silent somatic variants per tumor. One of the recurrently mutated genes was FGFR1, encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, which was recently revealed as an oncogene in pediatric brain tumors. Including a subsequent analysis of a larger cohort, activating FGFR1 mutations were detected in three of 80 sporadic pheochromocytomas (3.8%). Gene expression microarray profiling showed that these tumors clustered with NF1-, RET,- and HRAS-mutated pheochromocytomas, indicating activation of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signal transduction pathways.\n\nBesides RET and HRAS, FGFR1 is only the third protooncogene found to be recurrently mutated in pheochromocytomas. The results advance our biological understanding of pheochromocytoma and suggest that somatic FGFR1 activation is an important event in a subset of sporadic pheochromocytomas.",

    "title": "Linked-read whole-genome sequencing resolves common and private structural variants in multiple myeloma.",
    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and aggressive plasma cell malignancy characterized by a complex karyotype with multiple structural variants (SVs) and copy-number variations (CNVs). Linked-read whole-genome sequencing (lrWGS) allows for refined detection and reconstruction of SVs by providing long-range genetic information from standard short-read sequencing. This makes lrWGS an attractive solution for capturing the full genomic complexity of MM. Here we show that high-quality lrWGS data can be generated from low numbers of cells subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) without DNA purification. Using this protocol, we analyzed MM cells after FACS from 37 patients with MM using lrWGS. We found high concordance between lrWGS and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the detection of recurrent translocations and CNVs. Outside of the regions investigated by FISH, we identified >150 additional SVs and CNVs across the cohort. Analysis of the lrWGS data allowed for resolution of the structure of diverse SVs affecting the MYC and t(11;14) loci, causing the duplication of genes and gene regulatory elements. In addition, we identified private SVs causing the dysregulation of genes recurrently involved in translocations with the IGH locus and show that these can alter the molecular classification of MM. Overall, we conclude that lrWGS allows for the detection of aberrations critical for MM prognostics and provides a feasible route for providing comprehensive genetics. Implementing lrWGS could provide more accurate clinical prognostics, facilitate genomic medicine initiatives, and greatly improve the stratification of patients included in clinical trials.",

    "title": "High-resolution detection of chromosomal rearrangements in leukemias through mate pair whole genome sequencing.",
    "abstract": "The detection of recurrent somatic chromosomal rearrangements is standard of care for most leukemia types. Even though karyotype analysis-a low-resolution genome-wide chromosome analysis-is still the gold standard, it often needs to be complemented with other methods to increase resolution. To evaluate the feasibility and applicability of mate pair whole genome sequencing (MP-WGS) to detect structural chromosomal rearrangements in the diagnostic setting, we sequenced ten bone marrow samples from leukemia patients with recurrent rearrangements. Samples were selected based on cytogenetic and FISH results at leukemia diagnosis to include common rearrangements of prognostic relevance. Using MP-WGS and in-house bioinformatic analysis all sought rearrangements were successfully detected. In addition, unexpected complexity or additional, previously undetected rearrangements was unraveled in three samples. Finally, the MP-WGS analysis pinpointed the location of chromosome junctions at high resolution and we were able to identify the exact exons involved in the resulting fusion genes in all samples and the specific junction at the nucleotide level in half of the samples. The results show that our approach combines the screening character from karyotype analysis with the specificity and resolution of cytogenetic and molecular methods. As a result of the straightforward analysis and high-resolution detection of clinically relevant rearrangements, we conclude that MP-WGS is a feasible method for routine leukemia diagnostics of structural chromosomal rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "The caecum bridges the small and large intestine and plays a front-line role in discriminating gastrointestinal antigens. Although dysregulated in acute and chronic conditions, the tissue is often overlooked immunologically.\n\nTo address this issue, we applied single-cell transcriptomic-V(D)J sequencing to FACS-isolated CD45+ caecal patch/lamina propria leukocytes from a healthy (5-year-old) female rhesus macaque ex vivo and coupled these data to VDJ deep sequencing reads from haematopoietic tissues.\n\nWe found caecal NK cells and ILC3s to co-exist with a spectrum of effector T cells partially derived from SOX4 + recent thymic emigrants. Tolerogenic Vγ8Vδ1-T cells, plastic CD4+ T helper cells and GZMK + EOMES + and TMIGD2 + tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells were present and differed metabolically. An IL13 + GATA3 + Th2 subset expressing eicosanoid pathway enzymes was accompanied by IL1RL1 + GATA3 + regulatory T cells and a minor proportion of IgE+ plasma cells (PCs), illustrating tightly regulated type 2 immunity devoid of ILC2s. In terms of B lymphocyte lineages, caecal patch antigen-presenting memory B cells sat alongside germinal centre cells undergoing somatic hypermutation and differentiation into IGF1 + PCs. Prototypic gene expression signatures decreased across PC clusters, and notably, expanded IgA clonotypes could be traced in VDJ deep sequencing reads from additional compartments, including the bone marrow, supporting that these cells contribute a steady stream of systemic antibodies.\n\nThe data advance our understanding of caecal immunological function, revealing processes involved in barrier maintenance and molecular networks relevant to disease.",

    "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a homeostatic mechanism induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In acute/transient ER stress, decreased global protein synthesis and increased uORF mRNA translation are followed by normalization of protein synthesis. Here, we report a dramatically different response during chronic ER stress. This chronic ISR program is characterized by persistently elevated uORF mRNA translation and concurrent gene expression reprogramming, which permits simultaneous stress sensing and proteostasis. The program includes PERK-dependent switching to an eIF3-dependent translation initiation mechanism, resulting in partial, but not complete, translational recovery, which, together with transcriptional reprogramming, selectively bolsters expression of proteins with ER functions. Coordination of transcriptional and translational reprogramming prevents ER dysfunction and inhibits \"foamy cell\" development, thus establishing a molecular basis for understanding human diseases associated with ER dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The Stone Age record of South Africa provides some of the earliest evidence for the biological and cultural origins of Homo sapiens. While there is extensive genomic evidence for the selection of polymorphisms in response to pathogen-pressure in sub-Saharan Africa, e.g., the sickle cell trait which provides protection against malaria, there is inadequate direct human genomic evidence for ancient human-pathogen infection in the region. Here, we analysed shotgun metagenome libraries derived from the sequencing of a Later Stone Age hunter-gatherer child who lived near Ballito Bay, South Africa, c. 2000 years ago. This resulted in the identification of ancient DNA sequence reads homologous to Rickettsia felis, the causative agent of typhus-like flea-borne rickettsioses, and the reconstruction of an ancient R. felis genome.",

    "title": "Polysome-profiling in small tissue samples.",
    "abstract": "Polysome-profiling is commonly used to study translatomes and applies laborious extraction of efficiently translated mRNA (associated with >3 ribosomes) from a large volume across many fractions. This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for efficiently translated mRNA in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10-fold. The technique generates polysome-associated RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material and, when coupled with smart-seq2 single-cell RNA sequencing, translatomes in small tissues from biobanks can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved HCT-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associates with changes in mRNA abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in mRNA levels are buffered at the level of mRNA translation. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in biobanks.",

    "title": "Transcriptome analysis of embryonic domains in Norway spruce reveals potential regulators of suspensor cell death.",
    "abstract": "The terminal differentiation and elimination of the embryo-suspensor is the earliest manifestation of programmed cell death (PCD) during plant ontogenesis. Molecular regulation of suspensor PCD remains poorly understood. Norway spruce (Picea abies) embryos provide a powerful model for studying embryo development because of their large size, sequenced genome, and the possibility to obtain a large number of embryos at a specific developmental stage through somatic embryogenesis. Here, we have carried out global gene expression analysis of the Norway spruce embryo-suspensor versus embryonal mass (a gymnosperm analogue of embryo proper) using RNA sequencing. We have identified that suspensors have enhanced expression of the NAC domain-containing transcription factors, XND1 and ANAC075, previously shown to be involved in the initiation of developmental PCD in Arabidiopsis. The analysis has also revealed enhanced expression of Norway spruce homologues of the known executioners of both developmental and stress-induced cell deaths, such as metacaspase 9 (MC9), cysteine endopeptidase-1 (CEP1) and ribonuclease 3 (RNS3). Interestingly, a spruce homologue of bax inhibitor-1 (PaBI-1, for Picea abies BI-1), an evolutionarily conserved cell death suppressor, was likewise up-regulated in the embryo-suspensor. Since Arabidopsis BI-1 so far has been implicated only in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress induced cell death, we investigated its role in embryogenesis and suspensor PCD using RNA interference (RNAi). We have found that PaBI-1-deficient lines formed a large number of abnormal embryos with suppressed suspensor elongation and disturbed polarity. Cytochemical staining of suspensor cells has revealed that PaBI-1 deficiency suppresses vacuolar cell death and induces necrotic type of cell death previously shown to compromise embryo development. This study demonstrates that a large number of cell-death components are conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms and establishes a new role for BI-1 in the progression of vacuolar cell death.",

    "abstract": "The cell transition from an inflammatory phase to a subsequent proliferative phase is crucial for wound healing, yet the driving mechanism remains unclear. By profiling lncRNA expression changes during human skin wound healing and screening lncRNA functions, we identify SNHG26 as a pivotal regulator in keratinocyte progenitors underpinning this phase transition. Snhg26-deficient mice exhibit impaired wound repair characterized by delayed re-epithelization accompanied by exacerbated inflammation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with gain-of-function and loss-of-function of SNHG26 in vitro and ex vivo reveals its specific role in facilitating inflammatory-to-proliferative state transition of keratinocyte progenitors. A mechanistic study unravels that SNHG26 interacts with and relocates the transcription factor ILF2 from inflammatory genomic loci, such as JUN, IL6, IL8, and CCL20, to the genomic locus of LAMB3. Collectively, our findings suggest that lncRNAs play cardinal roles in expediting tissue repair and regeneration and may constitute an invaluable reservoir of therapeutic targets in reparative medicine.",

    "title": "Cytoskeletal alterations in neuronal cells implicate Toxoplasma gondii secretory machinery and host microRNA-containing extracellular vesicles.",
    "abstract": "The widespread protozoan Toxoplasma gondii chronically infects neural tissue in vertebrates and is linked to various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. However, its effects on sparsely infected neurons and on broader neural circuits remain elusive. Our study reveals that T. gondii infection disrupts cytoskeletal dynamics in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and primary cortical neurons. Infected neuronal cells undergo significant cytomorphological changes, including retraction of dendritic extensions and alterations in microtubule and F-actin networks, across both parasite genotypes I and II. These cytoskeletal alterations were notably diminished in cells exposed to T. gondii mutants with impaired secretion via the MYR translocon, and were independent of intraneuronal parasite replication. Moreover, a bystander effect was observed, with supernatants from T. gondii-challenged cells inducing similar cytoskeletal changes in uninfected cells. Analyses of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in supernatants revealed differential expression of host microRNAs in response to infection, most notably the upregulation of miR-221-3p, a microRNA not previously associated with T. gondii. The data indicate that unidentified parasite-derived effector(s) secreted via the MYR translocon, in conjunction with MYR-independently induced EV-associated host microRNAs, mediate cytoskeletal alterations in both infected and bystander neuronal cells. The findings provide new insights into molecular mechanisms by which T. gondii infection may disrupt neural networks, shedding light on its potential role in neuronal dysregulation.",

    "title": "Ancient Sheep Genomes Reveal Four Millennia of North European Short-Tailed Sheep in the Baltic Sea Region.",
    "abstract": "Sheep are among the earliest domesticated livestock species, with a wide variety of breeds present today. However, it remains unclear how far back this diversity goes, with formal documentation only dating back a few centuries. North European short-tailed (NEST) breeds are often assumed to be among the oldest domestic sheep populations, even thought to represent relicts of the earliest sheep expansions during the Neolithic period reaching Scandinavia <6,000 years ago. This study sequenced the genomes (up to 11.6X) of five sheep remains from the Baltic islands of Gotland and Åland, dating from the Late Neolithic (∼4,100 cal BP) to historical times (∼1,600 CE). Our findings indicate that these ancient sheep largely possessed the genetic characteristics of modern NEST breeds, suggesting a substantial degree of long-term continuity of this sheep type in the Baltic Sea region. Despite the wide temporal spread, population genetic analyses show high levels of affinity between the ancient genomes and they also exhibit relatively high genetic diversity when compared to modern NEST breeds, implying a loss of diversity in most breeds during the last centuries associated with breed formation and recent bottlenecks. Our results shed light on the development of breeds in Northern Europe specifically as well as the development of genetic diversity in sheep breeds, and their expansion from the domestication center in general.",

Patients positive for Sjögren's syndrome antigen A/Sjögren syndrome antigen B (SSA/SSB) autoantibodies are more prone to systemic disease manifestations and adverse outcomes. We aimed to determine the role of B cell composition, gene expression, and B cell receptor usage in pSS subgroups stratified for SSA/SSB antibodies.\r\n\r\nOver 230,000 B cells were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with pSS (n = 6 SSA-, n = 8 SSA+ single positive and n = 10 SSA/SSB+ double positive) and four healthy controls and processed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) gene sequencing (scVDJ-seq).\r\n\r\nWe show that SSA/SSB+ patients present the highest and lowest proportion of naïve and memory B cells, respectively, and the highest up-regulation of interferon-induced genes across all B cell subtypes. Differential usage of IGHV showed that IGHV1-69 and IGHV4-30-4 were more often used in all pSS subgroups compared with controls. Memory B cells from SSA/SSB+ patients displayed a higher proportion of cells with unmutated VDJ transcripts compared with other pSS patient groups and controls, indicating altered somatic hypermutation processes. Comparison with previous studies revealed heterogeneous clonotype pools, with little overlap in CDR3 sequences. Joint analysis using scRNA-seq and scVDJ-seq data allowed unsupervised stratification of patients with pSS and identified novel parameters that correlated to disease manifestations and antibody status.\r\n\r\nWe describe heterogeneity and molecular characteristics in B cells from patients with pSS, providing clues to intrinsic differences in B cells that affect the phenotype and outcome and allowing stratification of patients with pSS at improved resolution.",

    "title": "Absence of oxygen effect on microbial structure and methane production during drying and rewetting events.",
    "abstract": "Natural environments with frequent drainage experience drying and rewetting events that impose fluctuations in water availability and oxygen exposure. These relatively dramatic cycles profoundly impact microbial activity in the environment and subsequent emissions of methane and carbon dioxide. In this study, we mimicked drying and rewetting events by submitting methanogenic communities from strictly anaerobic environments (anaerobic digestors) with different phylogenetic structures to consecutive desiccation events under aerobic (air) and anaerobic (nitrogen) conditions followed by rewetting. We showed that methane production quickly recovered after each rewetting, and surprisingly, no significant difference was observed between the effects of the aerobic or anaerobic desiccation events. There was a slight change in the microbial community structure and a decrease in methane production rates after consecutive drying and rewetting, which can be attributed to a depletion of the pool of available organic matter or the inhibition of the methanogenic communities. These observations indicate that in comparison to the drying and rewetting events or oxygen exposure, the initial phylogenetic structure and the organic matter quantity and quality exhibited a stronger influence on the methanogenic communities and overall microbial community responses. These results change the current paradigm of the sensitivity of strict anaerobic microorganisms to oxygen exposure.",

    "abstract": "The precise pattern and timing of speciation events that gave rise to all living placental mammals remain controversial. We provide a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of genetic variation across an alignment of 241 placental mammal genome assemblies, addressing prior concerns regarding limited genomic sampling across species. We compared neutral genome-wide phylogenomic signals using concatenation and coalescent-based approaches, interrogated phylogenetic variation across chromosomes, and analyzed extensive catalogs of structural variants. Interordinal relationships exhibit relatively low rates of phylogenomic conflict across diverse datasets and analytical methods. Conversely, X-chromosome versus autosome conflicts characterize multiple independent clades that radiated during the Cenozoic. Genomic time trees reveal an accumulation of cladogenic events before and immediately after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, implying important roles for Cretaceous continental vicariance and the K-Pg extinction in the placental radiation.",

    "title": "Epicardium-derived cells organize through tight junctions to replenish cardiac muscle in salamanders.",
    "abstract": "The contribution of the epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart, to cardiac regeneration has remained controversial due to a lack of suitable analytical tools. By combining genetic marker-independent lineage-tracing strategies with transcriptional profiling and loss-of-function methods, we report here that the epicardium of the highly regenerative salamander species Pleurodeles waltl has an intrinsic capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Following cryoinjury, CLDN6+ epicardium-derived cells appear at the lesion site, organize into honeycomb-like structures connected via focal tight junctions and undergo transcriptional reprogramming that results in concomitant differentiation into de novo cardiomyocytes. Ablation of CLDN6+ differentiation intermediates as well as disruption of their tight junctions impairs cardiac regeneration. Salamanders constitute the evolutionarily closest species to mammals with an extensive ability to regenerate heart muscle and our results highlight the epicardium and tight junctions as key targets in efforts to promote cardiac regeneration.",

    "title": "Prediction models of persistent taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy among breast cancer survivors using whole-exome sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Persistent taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is highly prevalent among early-stage breast cancer survivors (ESBCS) and has detrimental effect on quality of life. We leveraged logistic regression models to develop and validate polygenic prediction models to estimate the risk of persistent PN symptoms in a training cohort and validation cohort taking clinical risk factors into account. Based on 337 whole-exome sequenced ESBCS two of five prediction models for individual PN symptoms obtained AUC results above 60% when validated. Using the model for numbness in feet (35 SNVs) in the test cohort, 73% survivors were correctly predicted. For tingling in feet (55 SNVs) 70% were correctly predicted. Both models included SNVs from the ADAMTS20, APT6V0A2, CCDC88C, CYP2C8, EPHA5, NR1H3, PSKH2/APTV0D2, and SCN10A genes. For cramps in feet, difficulty climbing stairs and difficulty opening a jar the validation was unsuccessful. Polygenic prediction models including clinical risk factors can estimate the risk of persistent taxane-induced numbness in feet and tingling in feet in ESBCS.",

The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip in whole blood of 88 suicide attempters. Subjects were stratified into two groups based on the putative risk of later committed suicide (low- [n = 58] and high-risk [n = 30]) in dependency of SA method (violent or non-violent) and/or intent-to-die (high/low). Estimators of intrinsic and extrinsic EA acceleration, one marker optimized to predict physiological dysregulation (DNAmPhenoAge/AgeAccelPheno) and one optimized to predict lifespan (DNAmGrimAge/AgeAccelGrim) were investigated for associations to severity of SA, by univariate and multivariate analyses. The study was adequately powered to detect differences of 2.2 years in AgeAccelGrim in relation to SA severity. Baseline DNAmGrimAge exceeded chronological age by 7.3 years on average across all samples, conferring a mean 24.6% increase in relation to actual age. No individual EA acceleration marker was differentiated by suicidal risk group (p > 0.1). Thus, SA per se but not severity of SA is related to EA, implicating that excess non-suicidal mortality in SA is unrelated to risk of committed suicide. Preventative healthcare efforts aimed at curtailing excess mortality after SA may benefit from acting equally powerful to recognize somatic comorbidities irrespective of the severity inherent in the act itself.",

    "title": "Whole mitochondrial genome capture from faecal samples and museum-preserved specimens.",
    "abstract": "Population-scale molecular studies of endangered and cryptic species are often limited by access to high-quality samples. The use of noninvasively collected samples or museum-preserved specimens reduces the pressure on modern populations by removing the need to capture and handle live animals. However, endogenous DNA content in such samples is low, making shotgun sequencing a financially prohibitive approach. Here, we apply a target enrichment method to retrieve mitochondrial genomes from 65 museum specimens and 56 noninvasively collected faecal samples of two endangered great ape species, Grauer's gorilla and the eastern chimpanzee. We show that the applied method is suitable for a wide range of sample types that differ in endogenous DNA content, increasing the proportion of target reads to over 300-fold. By systematically evaluating biases introduced during target enrichment of pooled museum samples, we show that capture is less efficient for fragments shorter or longer than the baits, that the proportion of human contaminating reads increases postcapture although capture efficiency is lower for human compared to gorilla fragments with a gorilla-generated bait, and that the rate of jumping PCR is considerable, but can be controlled for with a double-barcoding approach. We succeed in capturing complete mitochondrial genomes from faecal samples, but observe reduced capture efficiency as sequence divergence increases between the bait and target species. As previously shown for museum specimens, we demonstrate here that mitochondrial genome capture from field-collected faecal samples is a robust and reliable approach for population-wide studies of nonmodel organisms.",

    "title": "Genetics of tibia bone properties of crossbred commercial laying hens in different housing systems.",
    "abstract": "Osteoporosis and bone fractures are a severe problem for the welfare of laying hens, with genetics and environment, such as housing system, each making substantial contributions to bone strength. In this work, we performed genetic analyses of bone strength, bone mineral density and bone composition, as well as body weight, in 860 commercial crossbred laying hens from two different companies, kept in either furnished cages or floor pens. We compared bone traits between housing systems and crossbreds, and performed a genome-wide association study of bone properties and body weight. As expected, the two housing systems produced a large difference in bone strength, with layers housed in floor pens having stronger bones. These differences were accompanied by differences in bone geometry, mineralisation and chemical composition. Genome-scans either combining or independently analysing the two housing systems revealed no genome-wide significant loci for bone breaking strength. We detected three loci for body weight that were shared between the housing systems on chromosomes 4, 6 and 27 (either genome-wide significant or suggestive) and these coincide with associations for bone length. In summary, we found substantial differences in bone strength, content and composition between hens kept in floor pens and furnished cages that could be attributed to greater physical activity in pen housing. We found little evidence for large-effect loci for bone strength in commercial crossbred hens, consistent with a highly polygenic architecture for bone strength in the production environment.​ The lack of consistent genetic associations between housing systems in combination with the differences in bone phenotypes could be due to gene-by-environment interactions with housing system or a lack of power to detect shared associations for bone strength.",

    "abstract": "Dietary factors may regulate the epigenome. We aimed to explore whether a diet intervention, including excess sugar, affects the methylome in human sperm, and to describe the sperm methylome. We used Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) to analyze DNA methylation in sperm taken at three time points from 15 males during a diet intervention; i) at baseline, ii) after one week on a standardized diet, and iii) after an additional week on a high-sugar diet providing 150% of their estimated total energy expenditure.\n\nWe identified seven nominal diet-associated differentially methylated regions in sperm (p < 0.05). The diet was nominally associated with methylation of 143 sites linked to fertility (e.g. AHRR, GNAS, and HDAC4), 313 sites in imprinted genes (e.g. GLIS3, PEG10, PEG3, and SNURF), and 42 sites in top 1%-expressed genes (e.g. CHD2) (p < 0.05). In sperm, 3'UTRs and introns had the highest levels of methylation, while 5'UTRs and CpG islands had the lowest levels. Non-expressed genes in human sperm were hypomethylated in exons compared with transcribed genes.\n\nIn human sperm, DNA methylation levels were linked to gene expression, and excess sugar had modest effects on methylation on imprinted and highly expressed genes, and genes affecting fertility.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of disease-related mortality in children. Causes of leukemia, the most common form, are largely unknown. Growing evidence points to an origin in-utero, when global redistribution of DNA methylation occurs driving tissue differentiation.\r\n\r\nEpigenome-wide DNA methylation was profiled in surrogate (blood) and target (bone marrow) tissues at birth, diagnosis, remission and relapse of pediatric pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) patients. Double-blinded analyses was performed between prospective cohorts extending from birth to diagnosis and retrospective studies backtracking from clinical disease to birth. Validation was carried out using independent technologies and populations.\r\n\r\nThe imprinted and immuno-modulating VTRNA2-1 was hypermethylated (FDR<0.05) at birth in nested cases relative to controls in all tested populations (totaling 317 cases and 483 controls), including European and Hispanic ancestries. VTRNA2-1 methylation was stable over follow-up years after birth and across surrogate, target and other tissues (n=5,023 tissues; 30 types). When profiled in leukemic tissues from two clinical cohorts (totaling 644 cases), VTRNA2-1 methylation exhibited higher levels at diagnosis relative to controls, it reset back to normal levels at remission, and then re-increased to above control levels at relapse. Hypermethylation was significantly associated with worse pre-B ALL patient survival and with reduced VTRNA2-1 expression (n=2,294 tissues; 26 types), supporting a functional and translational role for VTRNA2-1 methylation.\r\n\r\nThis study provides proof-of-concept to detect at birth epigenetic precursors of pediatric pre-B ALL. These alterations were reproducible with different technologies, in three continents and in two ethnicities, and can offer biomarkers for early detection and prognosis as well as actionable targets for therapy.",

    "title": "Target capture data resolve recalcitrant relationships in the coffee family (Rubioideae, Rubiaceae).",
    "abstract": "Subfamily Rubioideae is the largest of the main lineages in the coffee family (Rubiaceae), with over 8,000 species and 29 tribes. Phylogenetic relationships among tribes and other major clades within this group of plants are still only partly resolved despite considerable efforts. While previous studies have mainly utilized data from the organellar genomes and nuclear ribosomal DNA, we here use a large number of low-copy nuclear genes obtained via a target capture approach to infer phylogenetic relationships within Rubioideae. We included 101 Rubioideae species representing all but two (the monogeneric tribes Foonchewieae and Aitchinsonieae) of the currently recognized tribes, and all but one non-monogeneric tribe were represented by more than one genus. Using data from the 353 genes targeted with the universal Angiosperms353 probe set we investigated the impact of data type, analytical approach, and potential paralogs on phylogenetic reconstruction. We inferred a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of Rubioideae with the vast majority (or all) nodes being highly supported across all analyses and datasets and few incongruences between the inferred topologies. The results were similar to those of previous studies but novel relationships were also identified. We found that supercontigs [coding sequence (CDS) + non-coding sequence] clearly outperformed CDS data in levels of support and gene tree congruence. The full datasets (353 genes) outperformed the datasets with potentially paralogous genes removed (186 genes) in levels of support but increased gene tree incongruence slightly. The pattern of gene tree conflict at short internal branches were often consistent with high levels of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) due to rapid speciation in the group. While concatenation- and coalescence-based trees mainly agreed, the observed phylogenetic discordance between the two approaches may be best explained by their differences in accounting for ILS. The use of target capture data greatly improved our confidence and understanding of the Rubioideae phylogeny, highlighted by the increased support for previously uncertain relationships and the increased possibility to explore sources of underlying phylogenetic discordance.",

    "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hESC-RPE) are a promising cell source to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Despite several ongoing clinical studies, a detailed mapping of transient cellular states during in vitro differentiation has not been performed. Here, we conduct single-cell transcriptomic profiling of an hESC-RPE differentiation protocol that has been developed for clinical use. Differentiation progressed through a culture diversification recapitulating early embryonic development, whereby cells rapidly acquired a rostral embryo patterning signature before converging toward the RPE lineage. At intermediate steps, we identified and examined the potency of an NCAM1+ retinal progenitor population and showed the ability of the protocol to suppress non-RPE fates. We demonstrated that the method produces a pure RPE pool capable of maturing further after subretinal transplantation in a large-eyed animal model. Our evaluation of hESC-RPE differentiation supports the development of safe and efficient pluripotent stem cell-based therapies for AMD.",

    "title": "Variations of gastric corpus microbiota are associated with early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and squamous dysplasia.",
    "abstract": "Observational studies revealed a relationship between changes in gastric mucosa and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) which suggested a possible role for gastric microbiota in ESCC carcinogenesis. In this study we aimed to compare pattern of gastric corpus microbiota in ESCC with normal esophagus. Cases were included subjects with early ESCC (stage I-II) and esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) as the cancer precursor. Control groups included age and sex-matched subjects with mid-esophagus esophagitis (diseased-control), and histologically normal esophagus (healthy-control). DNA was extracted from snap-frozen gastric corpus tissues and 16S rRNA was sequenced on GS-FLX Titanium. After noise removal, an average of 3004 reads per sample was obtained from 93 subjects. We applied principal coordinate analysis to ordinate distances from beta diversity data. Pattern of gastric microbiota using Unifrac (p = 0.004) and weighted Unifrac distances (p = 0.018) statistically varied between cases and healthy controls. Sequences were aligned to SILVA database and Clostridiales and Erysipelotrichales orders were more abundant among cases after controling for multiple testing (p = 0.011). No such difference was observed between mid-esophagitis and healthy controls. This study is the first to show that composition of gastric corpus mucosal microbiota differs in early ESCC and ESD from healthy esophagus.",

    "title": "Allorecognition genes drive reproductive isolation in Podospora anserina.",
    "abstract": "Allorecognition, the capacity to discriminate self from conspecific non-self, is a ubiquitous organismal feature typically governed by genes evolving under balancing selection. Here, we show that in the fungus Podospora anserina, allorecognition loci controlling vegetative incompatibility (het genes), define two reproductively isolated groups through pleiotropic effects on sexual compatibility. These two groups emerge from the antagonistic interactions of the unlinked loci het-r (encoding a NOD-like receptor) and het-v (encoding a methyltransferase and an MLKL/HeLo domain protein). Using a combination of genetic and ecological data, supported by simulations, we provide a concrete and molecularly defined example whereby the origin and coexistence of reproductively isolated groups in sympatry is driven by pleiotropic genes under balancing selection.",

    "abstract": "The ability to accurately estimate risk of suicide deaths on an individual level remains elusive.\n\nThis study reports on a case-control study set-up from a well-characterized cohort of 88 predominantly female suicide attempters (SA), stratified into low- (n = 57) and high-risk groups (n = 31) based on reports of later death by suicide, as well as degree of intent-to-die and lethality of SA method. We perform an unbiased analysis of 12,930 whole-blood derived CpG-sites (Illumina Infinium EPIC BeadChip) previously demonstrated to be more conciliable with brain-derived variations. The candidate site was validated by pyrosequencing. External replication was performed in (1) relation to age at index suicide attempt in 97 women with emotionally unstable personality disorder (whole-blood) and (2) death by suicide in a mixed group of 183 prefrontal-cortex (PFC) derived samples who died by suicide or from non-psychiatric etiologies.\n\nCYP2D6-coupled CpG-site cg07016288 was hypomethylated in severe suicidal behavior (p < 10E-06). Results were validated by pyrosequencing (p < 0.01). Replication analyses demonstrate hypomethylation of cg07016288 in relation to age at index SA in females (p < 0.05) and hypermethylation in PFC of male suicide completers (p < 0.05).\n\nGenotyping of CYP2D6 was not performed and CpG-site associations to gene expression were not explored.\n\nCYP2D6-coupled epigenetic markers are hypomethylated in females in dependency of features known to confer increased risk of suicide deaths and hypermethylated in PFC of male suicide completers. Further elucidating the role of CYP2D6 in severe suicidality or suicide deaths hold promise to deduce clinically meaningful results.",

    "abstract": "Relapse after complete remission (CR) remains the main cause of mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies and, therefore, improved biomarkers for early prediction of relapse remains a critical goal toward development and assessment of preemptive relapse treatment. Because the significance of cancer stem cells as a source of relapses remains unclear, we investigated whether mutational screening for persistence of rare cancer stem cells would enhance measurable residual disease (MRD) and early relapse prediction after transplantation. In a retrospective study of patients who relapsed and patients who achieved continuous-CR with myelodysplastic syndromes and related myeloid malignancies, combined flow cytometric cell sorting and mutational screening for persistence of rare relapse-initiating stem cells was performed in the bone marrow at multiple CR time points after transplantation. In 25 CR samples from 15 patients that later relapsed, only 9 samples were MRD-positive in mononuclear cells (MNCs) whereas flowcytometric-sorted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were MRD-positive in all samples, and always with a higher variant allele frequency than in MNCs (mean, 97-fold). MRD-positivity in HSPCs preceded MNCs in multiple sequential samples, in some cases preceding relapse by >2 years. In contrast, in 13 patients in long-term continuous-CR, HSPCs remained MRD-negative. Enhanced MRD sensitivity was also observed in total CD34+ cells, but HSPCs were always more clonally involved (mean, 8-fold). In conclusion, identification of relapse-initiating cancer stem cells and mutational MRD screening for their persistence consistently enhances MRD sensitivity and earlier prediction of relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

    "abstract": "microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is a common feature of cancer cells, but the complex roles of miRNAs in cancer are not fully elucidated. Here, we used functional genomics to identify oncogenic miRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer and evaluate their impact on response to epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-targeting therapy. Our data demonstrate that miRNAs with an AAGUGC motif in their seed sequence increase both cancer cell proliferation and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Global transcriptomics, proteomics and target prediction resulted in the identification of several tumor suppressors involved in the G1/S transition as AAGUGC-miRNA targets. The clinical implications of our findings were evaluated by analysis of AAGUGC-miRNA expression in multiple cancer types, supporting the link between this miRNA seed family, their tumor suppressor targets and cancer cell proliferation. In conclusion, we propose the AAGUGC seed motif as an oncomotif and that oncomotif-miRNAs promote cancer cell proliferation. These findings have potential therapeutic implications, especially in selecting patients for EGFR-targeting therapy.",

    "title": "High prevalence of somatic PIK3CA and TP53 pathogenic variants in the normal mammary gland tissue of sporadic breast cancer patients revealed by duplex sequencing.",
    "abstract": "The mammary gland undergoes hormonally stimulated cycles of proliferation, lactation, and involution. We hypothesized that these factors increase the mutational burden in glandular tissue and may explain high cancer incidence rate in the general population, and recurrent disease. Hence, we investigated the DNA sequence variants in the normal mammary gland, tumor, and peripheral blood from 52 reportedly sporadic breast cancer patients. Targeted resequencing of 542 cancer-associated genes revealed subclonal somatic pathogenic variants of: PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, MAP3K1, CDH1, RB1, NCOR1, MED12, CBFB, TBX3, and TSHR in the normal mammary gland at considerable allelic frequencies (9 × 10-2- 5.2 × 10-1), indicating clonal expansion. Further evaluation of the frequently damaged PIK3CA and TP53 genes by ultra-sensitive duplex sequencing demonstrated a diversified picture of multiple low-level subclonal (in 10-2-10-4 alleles) hotspot pathogenic variants. Our results raise a question about the oncogenic potential in non-tumorous mammary gland tissue of breast-conserving surgery patients.",

    "abstract": "Thiocyanate is a toxic compound produced by the mining and metallurgy industries that needs to be remediated prior to its release into the environment. If the industry is situated at high altitudes or near the poles, economic factors require a low temperature treatment process. Microbial fuel cells are a developing technology that have the benefits of both removing such toxic compounds while recovering electrical energy. In this study, simultaneous thiocyanate degradation and electrical current generation was demonstrated and it was suggested that extracellular electron transfer to the anode occurred. Investigation of the microbial community by 16S rRNA metatranscriptome reads supported that the anode attached and planktonic anolyte consortia were dominated by a ",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process often associated with comorbid asthma. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of single T helper (TH) cells from nasal polyps of patients with CRSwNP and validated these findings using multiparameter flow cytometry. Polyp tissue contained suppressive T regulatory (Treg) cells, TH2 cells, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and three transcriptionally distinct subsets of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CTL). GATA3 expression was a feature of polyp Treg cells, whereas TH2 cells highly expressed TCN1, CD200R, and HPGDS and were enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism. Only a portion of polyp TH2 cells expressed the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2, whereas a subpopulation of CD109+CRTH2- TH2 cells expressed mRNA for common inhibitor receptors including LAG3 and TIM3 and produced IL-10. Together, we resolved the complexity of TH cells in patients with CRSwNP, identifying several distinct clusters of CD4+ CTL and a population of CD109+CRTH2- TH2 cells with putative regulatory potential.",
