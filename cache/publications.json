    "title": "Meiotic drive against chromosome fusions in butterfly hybrids.",
    "abstract": "Species frequently differ in the number and structure of chromosomes they harbor, but individuals that are heterozygous for chromosomal rearrangements may suffer from reduced fitness. Chromosomal rearrangements like fissions and fusions can hence serve as a mechanism for speciation between incipient lineages, but their evolution poses a paradox. How can rearrangements get fixed between populations if heterozygotes have reduced fitness? One solution is that this process predominantly occurs in small and isolated populations, where genetic drift can override natural selection. However, fixation is also more likely if a novel rearrangement is favored by a transmission bias, such as meiotic drive. Here, we investigate chromosomal transmission distortion in hybrids between two wood white (Leptidea sinapis) butterfly populations with extensive karyotype differences. Using data from two different crossing experiments, we uncover that there is a transmission bias favoring the ancestral chromosomal state for derived fusions, a result that shows that chromosome fusions actually can fix in populations despite being counteracted by meiotic drive. This means that meiotic drive not only can promote runaway chromosome number evolution and speciation, but also that it can be a conservative force acting against karyotypic change and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Based on our results, we suggest a mechanistic model for why chromosome fusion mutations may be opposed by meiotic drive and discuss factors contributing to karyotype evolution in Lepidoptera.",

    "title": "Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of hoarding symptoms in 27,537 individuals.",
    "abstract": "Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a mental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties discarding or parting with possessions, often resulting in cluttered living spaces, distress, and impairment. Its etiology is largely unknown, but twin studies suggest that it is moderately heritable. In this study, we pooled phenotypic and genomic data from seven international cohorts (N = 27,537 individuals) and conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of parent- or self-reported hoarding symptoms (HS). We followed up the results with gene-based and gene-set analyses, as well as leave-one-out HS polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses. To examine a possible genetic association between hoarding symptoms and other phenotypes we conducted cross-trait PRS analyses. Though we did not report any genome-wide significant SNPs, we report heritability estimates for the twin-cohorts between 26-48%, and a SNP-heritability of 11% for an unrelated sub-cohort. Cross-trait PRS analyses showed that the genetic risk for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder were significantly associated with hoarding symptoms. We also found suggestive evidence for an association with educational attainment. There were no significant associations with other phenotypes previously linked to HD, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. To conclude, we found that HS are heritable, confirming and extending previous twin studies but we had limited power to detect any genome-wide significant loci. Much larger samples will be needed to further extend these findings and reach a \"gene discovery zone\". To move the field forward, future research should not only include genetic analyses of quantitative hoarding traits in larger samples, but also in samples of individuals meeting strict diagnostic criteria for HD, and more ethnically diverse samples.",

    "abstract": "Whether loci that influence fasting glucose (FG) and fasting insulin (FI) levels, as identified by genome-wide association studies, modify associations of diet with FG or FI is unknown. We utilized data from 15 U.S. and European cohort studies comprising 51,289 persons without diabetes to test whether genotype and diet interact to influence FG or FI concentration. We constructed a diet score using study-specific quartile rankings for intakes of whole grains, fish, fruits, vegetables, and nuts/seeds (favorable) and red/processed meats, sweets, sugared beverages, and fried potatoes (unfavorable). We used linear regression within studies, followed by inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis, to quantify 1) associations of diet score with FG and FI levels and 2) interactions of diet score with 16 FG-associated loci and 2 FI-associated loci. Diet score (per unit increase) was inversely associated with FG (β = -0.004 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval: -0.005, -0.003) and FI (β = -0.008 ln-pmol/L, 95% confidence interval: -0.009, -0.007) levels after adjustment for demographic factors, lifestyle, and body mass index. Genotype variation at the studied loci did not modify these associations. Healthier diets were associated with lower FG and FI concentrations regardless of genotype at previously replicated FG- and FI-associated loci. Studies focusing on genomic regions that do not yield highly statistically significant associations from main-effect genome-wide association studies may be more fruitful in identifying diet-gene interactions.",

    "abstract": "Mapping-by-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for genetic mapping in several plant and animal species. As this resequencing-based method requires a reference genome, its application to complex plant genomes with incomplete and fragmented sequence resources remains challenging. We perform exome sequencing of phenotypic bulks of a mapping population of barley segregating for a mutant phenotype that increases the rate of leaf initiation. Read depth analysis identifies a candidate gene, which is confirmed by the analysis of independent mutant alleles. Our method illustrates how the genomic resources of barley together with exome resequencing can underpin mapping-by-sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Gene silencing may have a direct or indirect impact on many biological processes in eukaryotic cells, and is a useful tool for the determination of the roles of specific genes. In this article, we report silencing in Phytophthora infestans, an oomycete pathogen of potato and tomato. Gene silencing is known to occur in P. infestans, but its genetic basis has yet to be determined. Genes encoding the major components of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, Dicer-like (Pidcl1), Argonaute (Piago1-5) and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Pirdr1), were identified in the P. infestans genome by comparative genomics, together with families of other genes potentially involved in gene silencing, such as histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, DEAD helicases, chromodomain proteins and a class 1 RNaseIII. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated transcript accumulation for all candidate genes throughout the asexual lifecycle and plant infection, but at different levels of mRNA abundance. A functional assay was developed in which silencing of the sporulation-associated Picdc14 gene was released by the treatment of protoplasts with in vitro-synthesized double-stranded RNAs homologous to Pidcl1, Piago1/2 and histone deacetylase Pihda1. These results suggest that the components of gene silencing, namely Dicer-like, Argonaute and histone deacetylase, are functional in P. infestans. Our data demonstrate that this oomycete possesses canonical gene silencing pathways similar to those of other eukaryotes.",

    "title": "Elucidating the interactions between the human gut microbiota and its host through metabolic modeling.",
    "abstract": "Increased understanding of the interactions between the gut microbiota, diet and environmental effects may allow us to design efficient treatment strategies for addressing global health problems. Existence of symbiotic microorganisms in the human gut provides different functions for the host such as conversion of nutrients, training of the immune system, and resistance to pathogens. The gut microbiome also plays an influential role in maintaining human health, and it is a potential target for prevention and treatment of common disorders including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Due to the extreme complexity of such disorders, it is necessary to develop mathematical models for deciphering the role of its individual elements as well as the entire system and such models may assist in better understanding of the interactions between the bacteria in the human gut and the host by use of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). Recently, GEMs have been employed to explore the interactions between predominant bacteria in the gut ecosystems. Additionally, these models enabled analysis of the contribution of each species to the overall metabolism of the microbiota through the integration of omics data. The outcome of these studies can be used for proposing optimal conditions for desired microbiome phenotypes. Here, we review the recent progress and challenges for elucidating the interactions between the human gut microbiota and host through metabolic modeling. We discuss how these models may provide scaffolds for analyzing high-throughput data, developing probiotics and prebiotics, evaluating the effects of probiotics and prebiotics and eventually designing clinical interventions.",

    "title": "The evaluation of biogenic silica in brackish and freshwater strains reveals links between phylogeny and silica accumulation in picocyanobacteria.",
    "abstract": "Through biosilicification, organisms incorporate dissolved silica (dSi) and deposit it as biogenic silica (bSi), driving the silicon (Si) cycle in aquatic systems. While Si accumulation in marine picocyanobacteria has been recently observed, its mechanisms and ecological implications remain unclear. This study investigates biosilicification in marine and brackish picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus clade and two model freshwater coccoid cyanobacteria. Brackish strains showed significantly higher Si quotas when supplemented with external dSi (100 µM) compared to controls (up to 60.0 ± 7.3 amol Si.cell-1 versus 9.2 to 16.3 ± 2.9 amol Si.cell-1). Conversely, freshwater strains displayed no significant differences in Si quotas between dSi-enriched treatments and controls, emphasizing that not all phytoplanktons without an obligate Si requirement accumulate this element. The Si-accumulating marine and brackish picocyanobacteria clustered within the Synechococcus clade, whereas their freshwater counterparts formed a distinct sister group, suggesting a link between phylogeny and silicification. Rapid culture growth caused increased pH and led to dSi precipitation, influencing apparent dSi uptake; this was mitigated by pH control through bubbling. This phenomenon has significant implications for natural systems affected by phytoplankton blooms. In such environments, pH-induced silicon precipitation may reduce dSi availability impacting Si-dependent populations like diatoms. Our findings suggest brackish picocyanobacteria could significantly influence the Si cycle through at least two mechanisms: cellular Si accumulation and biologically induced changes in dSi concentrations.IMPORTANCEThis work provides the first evidence of biogenic silica accumulation in brackish picocyanobacteria and uncovers a link between phylogeny and biosilicification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that picocyanobacterial growth induces pH-dependent silica precipitation, which could lead to overestimations of cellular Si quotas by up to 85%. This process may drive substantial silica precipitation in highly productive freshwater and coastal marine systems, with potential effects on silica cycling and the population dynamics of Si-dependent phytoplankton. The extent of biosilicification in modern picocyanobacteria offers insights into the rock record, shedding light on the evolutionary and ecological dynamics that influence sedimentary processes and the preservation of biosilicification signatures in geological formations. Overall, this research adds to the significant impact that microorganisms lacking an obligate silica requirement may have on silica dynamics.",

    "title": "An MBL-like protein may interfere with the activation of the proPO-system, an important innate immune reaction in invertebrates.",
    "abstract": "An important characteristic of the innate immune systems of crayfish and other arthropods is the activation of a serine proteinase cascade in the hemolymph, which results in the activation of prophenoloxidase and subsequently leading to the formation of toxic quinones and melanin. Although no true complement homologues have been detected in crayfish or crustaceans, several proteins with similarities to vertebrate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are involved in the lectin pathway of complement activation in vertebrates, are present. One is a C-type lectin, a mannose-binding lectin (Pl-MBL), which is secreted from granular hemocytes. Here we report that Pl-MBL has LPS-binding capacity and is dependent upon high Ca(2+) for its solubility and Pl-MBL interferes with proPO activation in vitro when HLS is prepared at high Ca(2+). The proPO-activating system is efficiently activated by microbial polysaccharides and it has to be neatly regulated to avoid activation in places where it is inappropriate and the active enzyme PO should be prevented from spreading throughout the body of the animal. This may be particularly important during molting when proPO is involved in hardening of a new cuticle and the animal is vulnerable to microbes. The presence of high amount of Pl-MBL in the granular hemocytes may play a role in this process. Since a hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS) prepared at 100 mM Ca(2+) could become activated when the concentration of LPS was increased up to 3 mg/ml, this may indicate that Pl-MBL acts as a scavenger for LPS to prevent spreading of LPS in the hemolymph to avoid further activation of the proPO-system.",

    "abstract": "The pathway for RNA interference is widespread in metazoans and participates in numerous cellular tasks, from gene silencing to chromatin remodeling and protection against retrotransposition. The unicellular eukaryote Trypanosoma cruzi is missing the canonical RNAi pathway and is unable to induce RNAi-related processes. To further understand alternative RNA pathways operating in this organism, we have performed deep sequencing and genome-wide analyses of a size-fractioned cDNA library (16-61 nt) from the epimastigote life stage. Deep sequencing generated 582,243 short sequences of which 91% could be aligned with the genome sequence. About 95-98% of the aligned data (depending on the haplotype) corresponded to small RNAs derived from tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs. The largest class consisted of tRNA-derived small RNAs which primarily originated from the 3' end of tRNAs, followed by small RNAs derived from rRNA. The remaining sequences revealed the presence of 92 novel transcribed loci, of which 79 did not show homology to known RNA classes.",

    "title": "Interplay between eutrophication and climate warming on bacterial communities in coastal sediments differs depending on water depth and oxygen history.",
    "abstract": "Coastal aquatic systems suffer from nutrient enrichment, which results in accelerated eutrophication effects due to increased microbial metabolic rates. Climate change related prolonged warming will likely accelerate existing eutrophication effects, including low oxygen concentrations. However, how the interplay between these environmental changes will alter coastal ecosystems is poorly understood. In this study, we compared 16S rRNA gene amplicon based bacterial communities in coastal sediments of a Baltic Sea basin in November 2013 and 2017 at three sites along a water depth gradient with varying bottom water oxygen histories. The shallow site showed changes of only 1.1% in relative abundance of bacterial populations in 2017 compared to 2013, while the deep oxygen-deficient site showed up to 11% changes in relative abundance including an increase of sulfate-reducing bacteria along with a 36% increase in organic matter content. The data suggested that bacterial communities in shallow sediments were more resilient to seasonal oxygen decline, while bacterial communities in sediments subjected to long-term hypoxia seemed to be sensitive to oxygen changes and were likely to be under hypoxic/anoxic conditions in the future. Our data demonstrate that future climate changes will likely fuel eutrophication related spread of low oxygen zones.",

    "title": "High cortisol in 5-year-old children causes loss of DNA methylation in SINE retrotransposons: a possible role for ZNF263 in stress-related diseases.",
    "abstract": "Childhood stress leads to increased risk of many adult diseases, such as major depression and cardiovascular disease. Studies show that adults with experienced childhood stress have specific epigenetic changes, but to understand the pathways that lead to disease, we also need to study the epigenetic link prospectively in children.\n\nHere, we studied a homogenous group of 48 5-year-old children. By combining hair cortisol measurements (a well-documented biomarker for chronic stress), with whole-genome DNA-methylation sequencing, we show that high cortisol associates with a genome-wide decrease in DNA methylation and targets short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs; a type of retrotransposon) and genes important for calcium transport: phenomena commonly affected in stress-related diseases and in biological aging. More importantly, we identify a zinc-finger transcription factor, ZNF263, whose binding sites where highly overrepresented in regions experiencing methylation loss. This type of zinc-finger protein has previously shown to be involved in the defense against retrotransposons.\n\nOur results show that stress in preschool children leads to changes in DNA methylation similar to those seen in biological aging. We suggest that this may affect future disease susceptibility by alterations in the epigenetic mechanisms that keep retrotransposons dormant. Future treatments for stress- and age-related diseases may therefore seek to target zinc-finger proteins that epigenetically control retrotransposon reactivation, such as ZNF263.",

    "title": "Immobilization of sulfate and thiosulfate-reducing biomass on sand under haloalkaline conditions.",
    "abstract": "Biological sulfate and thiosulfate reduction under haloalkaline conditions can be applied to treat waste streams from biodesulfurization systems. However, the lack of microbial aggregation under haloalkaline conditions limits the volumetric rates of sulfate and thiosulfate reducing bioreactors. As biomass retention in haloalkaline bioreactors has not been studied before, sand was chosen as a biomass carrier material to increase cell retention and consequently raise the volumetric rates. The results showed that ~10 fold higher biomass concentrations could be achieved with sand, compared to previous studies without carrier addition. The volumetric rates of sulfate/thiosulfate reduction increased approximately 4.5 times. Biomass attachment to the sand was restricted to cavities within the sand particles. Acetate produced by acetogenic bacteria from H2 and CO2 was used as carbon source for biomass growth, while formate that was also produced from H2 and CO2 enhanced sulfate reduction. The microbial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and Tindallia related bacteria were probably responsible for formate formation from hydrogen. The community attached to the sand particles was similar to the suspended fraction, but the relative abundance of sequences most closely related to Desulfohalobiaceae was much higher in the attached fraction compared to the suspended fraction (30% and 13%, respectively). The results indicated that even though the biomass attachment to sand was poor, it still increased the biomass concentration and consequently the sulfate and thiosulfate reduction volumetric rates.",

    "abstract": "Human liver physiology and the genetic etiology of the liver diseases can potentially be elucidated through the identification of proteins with enriched expression in the liver. Here, we combined data from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and antibody-based immunohistochemistry across all major human tissues to explore the human liver proteome with enriched expression, as well as the cell type-enriched expression in hepatocyte and bile duct cells. We identified in total 477 protein-coding genes with elevated expression in the liver: 179 genes have higher expression as compared to all the other analyzed tissues; 164 genes have elevated transcript levels in the liver shared with at least one other tissue type; and an additional 134 genes have a mild level of increased expression in the liver. We identified the precise localization of these proteins through antibody-based protein profiling and the subcellular localization of these proteins through immunofluorescent-based profiling. We also identified the biological processes and metabolic functions associated with these proteins, investigated their contribution in the occurrence of liver diseases, and identified potential targets for their treatment. Our study demonstrates the use of RNA-Seq and antibody-based immunohistochemistry for characterizing the human liver proteome, as well as the use of tissue-specific proteins in identification of novel drug targets and discovery of biomarkers.-Kampf, C., Mardinoglu, A., Fagerberg, L., Hallström, B.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain remains a significant medical challenge with complex underlying mechanisms, and an urgent need for new treatments. Our research built and utilized the iPain single-cell atlas to study chronic pain progression in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. We discovered that senescence of a small subset of pain-sensing neurons may be a driver of chronic pain. This mechanism was observed in animal models after nerve injury and in human patients diagnosed with chronic pain or diabetic painful neuropathy. Notably, treatment with senolytics, drugs that remove senescent cells, reversed pain symptoms in mice post-injury. These findings highlight the role of cellular senescence in chronic pain development, demonstrate the therapeutic potential of senolytic treatments, and underscore the value of the iPain atlas for future pain research.",

    "abstract": "The Baltic Sea receives large nitrogen inputs by diazotrophic (N2-fixing) heterocystous cyanobacteria but the significance of heterotrophic N2 fixation has not been studied. Here, the diversity, abundance and transcription of the nifH fragment of the nitrogenase enzyme in two basins of the Baltic Sea proper was examined. N2 fixation was measured at the surface (5 m) and in anoxic water (200 m). Vertical sampling profiles of >10 and <10 μm size fractions were collected in 2007, 2008 and 2011 at the Gotland Deep and in 2011 in the Bornholm Basin. Both of these stations are characterized by permanently anoxic bottom water. The 454-pyrosequencing nifH analysis revealed a diverse assemblage of nifH genes related to alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacteria (nifH cluster I) and anaerobic bacteria (nifH cluster III) at and below the chemocline. Abundances of genes and transcripts of seven diazotrophic phylotypes were investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealing abundances of heterotrophic nifH phylotypes of up to 2.1 × 10(7) nifH copies l(-1). Abundant nifH transcripts (up to 3.2 × 10(4) transcripts l(-1)) within nifH cluster III and co-occurring N2 fixation (0.44±0.26 nmol l(-1) day(-1)) in deep water suggests that heterotrophic diazotrophs are fixing N2 in anoxic ammonium-rich waters. Our results reveal that N2 fixation in the Baltic Sea is not limited to illuminated N-deplete surface waters and suggest that N2 fixation could also be of importance in other suboxic regions of the world's oceans.",

    "title": "Decoding a substantial set of samples in parallel by massive sequencing.",
    "abstract": "There has been a dramatic increase of throughput of sequenced bases in the last years but sequencing a multitude of samples in parallel has not yet developed equally. Here we present a novel strategy where the combination of two tags is used to link sequencing reads back to their origins from a pool of samples. By incorporating the tags in two steps sample-handling complexity is lowered by nearly 100 times compared to conventional indexing protocols. In addition, the method described here enables accurate identification and typing of thousands of samples in parallel. In this study the system was designed to test 4992 samples using only 122 tags. To prove the concept of the two-tagging method, the highly polymorphic 2(nd) exon of DLA-DRB1 in dogs and wolves was sequenced using the 454 GS FLX Titanium Chemistry. By requiring a minimum sequence depth of 20 reads per sample, 94% of the successfully amplified samples were genotyped. In addition, the method allowed digital detection of chimeric fragments. These results demonstrate that it is possible to sequence thousands of samples in parallel without complex pooling patterns or primer combinations. Furthermore, the method is highly scalable as only a limited number of additional tags leads to substantial increase of the sample size.",

    "title": "Targeted copy number screening highlights an intragenic deletion of WDR63 as the likely cause of human occipital encephalocele and abnormal CNS development in zebrafish.",
    "abstract": "Congenital malformations affecting the neural tube can present as isolated malformations or occur in association with other developmental abnormalities and syndromes. Using high resolution copy number screening in 66 fetuses with neural tube defects we identified 6 fetuses with likely pathogenic mutations, three aneuploidies (one trisomy 13 and two trisomy 18) and three deletions previously reported in NTDs (one 22q11.2 deletion and two 1p36 deletions) corresponding to 9% of the cohort. In addition, we identified five rare deletions and two duplications of uncertain significance including a rare intragenic heterozygous in-frame WDR63 deletion in a fetus with occipital encephalocele. Whole genome sequencing verified the deletion and excluded known pathogenic variants. The deletion spans exons 14-17 resulting in the expression of a protein missing the third and fourth WD-repeat domains. These findings were supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated somatic deletions in zebrafish. Injection of two different sgRNA-pairs targeting relevant intronic regions resulted in a deletion mimicking the human deletion and a concomitant increase of abnormal embryos with body and brain malformations (41%, n = 161 and 62%, n = 224 respectively), including a sac-like brain protrusion (7% and 9%, p < 0.01). Similar results were seen with overexpression of RNA encoding the deleted variant in zebrafish (Total abnormal;46%, n = 255, P < 0.001) compared to overexpression of an equivalent amount of wild-type RNA (Total abnormal;3%, n = 177). We predict the in-frame WDR63 deletion to result in a dominant negative or gain of function form of WDR63. These are the first findings supporting a role for WDR63 in encephalocele formation.

    "title": "Identification of candidate genetic variants and altered protein expression in neural stem and mature neural cells support altered microtubule function to be an essential component in bipolar disorder.",
    "abstract": "Identification of causative genetic variants leading to the development of bipolar disorder (BD) could result in genetic tests that would facilitate diagnosis. A better understanding of affected genes and pathways is also necessary for targeting of genes that may improve treatment strategies. To date several susceptibility genes have been reported from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but little is known about specific variants that affect disease development. Here, we performed quantitative proteomics and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Quantitative proteomics revealed NLRP2 as the most significantly up-regulated protein in neural stem cells and mature neural cells obtained from BD-patient cell samples. These results are in concordance with our previously published transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, the levels of FEZ2 and CADM2 proteins were also significantly differentially expressed in BD compared to control derived cells. The levels of FEZ2 were significantly downregulated in neural stem cells (NSC) while CADM2 was significantly up-regulated in mature neuronal cell culture. Promising novel candidate mutations were identified in the ANK3, NEK3, NEK7, TUBB, ANKRD1, and BRD2 genes. A literature search of candidate variants and deregulated proteins revealed that there are several connections to microtubule function for the molecules putatively involved. Microtubule function in neurons is critical for axon structure and axonal transport. A functional dynamic microtubule is also needed for an advocate response to cellular and environmental stress. If microtubule dynamics is compromised by mutations, it could be followed by deregulated expression forming a possible explanation for the inherited vulnerability to stressful life events that have been proposed to trigger mood episodes in BD patients.",

    "title": "Analysis of the Human Prostate-Specific Proteome Defined by Transcriptomics and Antibody-Based Profiling Identifies TMEM79 and ACOXL as Two Putative, Diagnostic Markers in Prostate Cancer.",
    "abstract": "To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL.",

    "title": "Huntingtin Aggregation Impairs Autophagy, Leading to Argonaute-2 Accumulation and Global MicroRNA Dysregulation.",
    "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the presence of intracellular protein aggregates, resulting in alterations in autophagy. However, the consequences of impaired autophagy for neuronal function remain poorly understood. In this study, we used cell culture and mouse models of huntingtin protein aggregation as well as post-mortem material from patients with Huntington's disease to demonstrate that Argonaute-2 (AGO2) accumulates in the presence of neuronal protein aggregates and that this is due to impaired autophagy. Accumulation of AGO2, a key factor of the RNA-induced silencing complex that executes microRNA functions, results in global alterations of microRNA levels and activity. Together, these results demonstrate that impaired autophagy found in neurodegenerative diseases not only influences protein aggregation but also directly contributes to global alterations of intracellular post-transcriptional networks.",

    "title": "Draft Genome Sequence for the Tree Pathogen Phytophthora plurivora.",
    "abstract": "Species from the genus Phytophthora are well represented among organisms causing serious diseases on trees. Phytophthora plurivora has been implicated in long-term decline of woodland trees across Europe. Here we present a draft genome sequence of P. plurivora, originally isolated from diseased European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Malmö, Sweden. When compared with other sequenced Phytophthora species, the P. plurivora genome assembly is relatively compact, spanning 41 Mb. This is organized in 1,919 contigs and 1,898 scaffolds, encompassing 11,741 predicted genes, and has a repeat content of approximately 15%. Comparison of allele frequencies revealed evidence for tetraploidy in the sequenced isolate. As in other sequenced Phytophthora species, P. plurivora possesses genes for pathogenicity-associated RXLR and Crinkle and Necrosis effectors, predominantly located in gene-sparse genomic regions. Comparison of the P. plurivora RXLR effectors with orthologs in other sequenced species in the same clade (Phytophthora multivora and Phytophthora capsici) revealed that the orthologs were likely to be under neutral or purifying selection.",

Here, we report on the protein evidence for all genes predicted from the genome sequence based on manual annotation from literature (UniProt), antibody-based profiling in cells, tissues and organs and analysis of the transcript profiles using next generation sequencing in human cell lines of different origins. We estimate that there is good evidence for protein existence for 69% (n = 13985) of the human protein-coding genes, while 23% have only evidence on the RNA level and 7% still lack experimental evidence. Analysis of the expression patterns shows few tissue-specific proteins and approximately half of the genes expressed in all the analyzed cells. The status for each gene with regards to protein evidence is visualized in a chromosome-centric manner as part of a new version of the Human Protein Atlas ( www.proteinatlas.org ).",

    "title": "Scheffersomyces stipitis: a comparative systems biology study with the Crabtree positive yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",
    "abstract": "Scheffersomyces stipitis is a Crabtree negative yeast, commonly known for its capacity to ferment pentose sugars. Differently from Crabtree positive yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the onset of fermentation in S. stipitis is not dependent on the sugar concentration, but is regulated by a decrease in oxygen levels. Even though S. stipitis has been extensively studied due to its potential application in pentoses fermentation, a limited amount of information is available about its metabolism during aerobic growth on glucose. Here, we provide a systems biology based comparison between the two yeasts, uncovering the metabolism of S. stipitis during aerobic growth on glucose under batch and chemostat cultivations.\n\nStarting from the analysis of physiological data, we confirmed through 13C-based flux analysis the fully respiratory metabolism of S. stipitis when growing both under glucose limited or glucose excess conditions. The patterns observed showed similarity to the fully respiratory metabolism observed for S. cerevisiae under chemostat cultivations however, intracellular metabolome analysis uncovered the presence of several differences in metabolite patterns. To describe gene expression levels under the two conditions, we performed RNA sequencing and the results were used to quantify transcript abundances of genes from the central carbon metabolism and compared with those obtained with S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, genes involved in central pathways showed different patterns of expression, suggesting different regulatory networks between the two yeasts. Efforts were focused on identifying shared and unique families of transcription factors between the two yeasts through in silico transcription factors analysis, suggesting a different regulation of glycolytic and glucoenogenic pathways.\n\nThe work presented addresses the impact of high-throughput methods in describing and comparing the physiology of Crabtree positive and Crabtree negative yeasts. Based on physiological data and flux analysis we identified the presence of one metabolic condition for S. stipitis under aerobic batch and chemostat cultivations, which shows similarities to the oxidative metabolism observed for S. cerevisiae under chemostat cultivations. Through metabolome analysis and genome-wide transcriptomic analysis several differences were identified. Interestingly, in silico analysis of transciption factors was useful to address a different regulation of mRNAs of genes involved in the central carbon metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the metabolism of S. stiptis is investigated in details and is compared to S. cerevisiae. Our study provides useful results and allows for the possibility to incorporate these data into recently developed genome-scaled metabolic, thus contributing to improve future industrial applications of S. stipitis as cell factory.",

    "abstract": "Cell cultures are often used to study physiological processes in health and disease. It is well-known that cells change their gene expression in vitro compared to in vivo, but it is rarely experimentally addressed. High glucose is a known trigger of apoptosis in proximal tubular cells (PTC). Here we used RNA-seq to detect differentially expressed genes in cultures of primary rat PTC, 3 days old, compared to cells retrieved directly from rat outer renal cortex and between PTC exposed to 15 mM glucose and control for 8 h. The expression of 6,174 genes was significantly up- or downregulated in the cultures of PTC compared to the cells in the outer renal cortex. Most altered were mitochondrial and metabolism related genes. Gene expression of proapoptotic proteins were upregulated and gene expression of antiapoptotic proteins were downregulated in PTC. Expression of transporter related genes were generally downregulated. After 8 h, high glucose had not altered the gene expression in PTC. The current study provides evidence that cells alter their gene expression in vitro compared to in vivo and suggests that short-term high glucose exposure can trigger apoptosis in PTC without changing the gene expression levels of apoptotic proteins.",

    "title": "Parallel Evolution of Bower-Building Behavior in Two Groups of Bowerbirds Suggested by Phylogenomics.",
    "abstract": "The bowerbirds in New Guinea and Australia include species that build the largest and perhaps most elaborately decorated constructions outside of humans. The males use these courtship bowers, along with their displays, to attract females. In these species, the mating system is polygynous and the females alone incubate and feed the nestlings. The bowerbirds also include 10 species of the socially monogamous catbirds in which the male participates in most aspects of raising the young. How the bower-building behavior evolved has remained poorly understood, as no comprehensive phylogeny exists for the family. It has been assumed that the monogamous catbird clade is sister to all polygynous species. We here test this hypothesis using a newly developed pipeline for obtaining homologous alignments of thousands of exonic and intronic regions from genomic data to build a phylogeny. Our well-supported species tree shows that the polygynous, bower-building species are not monophyletic. The result suggests either that bower-building behavior is an ancestral condition in the family that was secondarily lost in the catbirds, or that it has arisen in parallel in two lineages of bowerbirds. We favor the latter hypothesis based on an ancestral character reconstruction showing that polygyny but not bower-building is ancestral in bowerbirds, and on the observation that Scenopoeetes dentirostris, the sister species to one of the bower-building clades, does not build a proper bower but constructs a court for male display. This species is also sexually monomorphic in plumage despite having a polygynous mating system. We argue that the relatively stable tropical and subtropical forest environment in combination with low predator pressure and rich food access (mostly fruit) facilitated the evolution of these unique life-history traits.

    "title": "Enhanced validation of antibodies for research applications.",
    "abstract": "There is a need for standardized validation methods for antibody specificity and selectivity. Recently, five alternative validation pillars were proposed to explore the specificity of research antibodies using methods with no need for prior knowledge about the protein target. Here, we show that these principles can be used in a streamlined manner for enhanced validation of research antibodies in Western blot applications. More than 6,000 antibodies were validated with at least one of these strategies involving orthogonal methods, genetic knockdown, recombinant expression, independent antibodies, and capture mass spectrometry analysis. The results show a path forward for efforts to validate antibodies in an application-specific manner suitable for both providers and users.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of the heritability of plasma fibrinogen concentration, an established predictor of cardiovascular disease, range from 34% to 50%. Genetic variants so far identified by genome-wide association studies explain only a small proportion (<2%) of its variation.\n\nWe conducted a meta-analysis of 28 genome-wide association studies including >90 000 subjects of European ancestry, the first genome-wide association meta-analysis of fibrinogen levels in 7 studies in blacks totaling 8289 samples, and a genome-wide association study in Hispanics totaling 1366 samples. Evaluation for association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with clinical outcomes included a total of 40 695 cases and 85 582 controls for coronary artery disease, 4752 cases and 24 030 controls for stroke, and 3208 cases and 46 167 controls for venous thromboembolism. Overall, we identified 24 genome-wide significant (P<5×10(-8)) independent signals in 23 loci, including 15 novel associations, together accounting for 3.7% of plasma fibrinogen variation. Gene-set enrichment analysis highlighted key roles in fibrinogen regulation for the 3 structural fibrinogen genes and pathways related to inflammation, adipocytokines, and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone signaling. Whereas lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a few loci were significantly associated with coronary artery disease, the combined effect of all 24 fibrinogen-associated lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms was not significant for coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism.\n\nWe identify 23 robustly associated fibrinogen loci, 15 of which are new. Clinical outcome analysis of these loci does not support a causal relationship between circulating levels of fibrinogen and coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism.",

    "abstract": "Anonychia/hyponychia congenita is a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder characterized by the absence (anonychia) or hypoplasia (hyponuchia) of finger- and/or toenails frequently caused by mutations in the R-spondin 4 (RSPO4) gene.\n\nThree hypo/anonychia consanguineous Pakistani families were ascertained and genotyped using microsatellite markers spanning the RSPO4 locus on chromosome 20p13. Mutation screening of the RSPO4 gene was carried out by direct sequencing of the entire coding region and all intron-exon boundaries.\n\nMutations in the RSPO4 gene were identified in all families including a novel missense mutation c.178C>T (p.R60W) and two recurrent variants c.353G>A (p.C118Y) and c.3G>A (p.M1I). The c.3G>A variant was identified in unaffected family members and a control sample in a homozygous state.\n\nThis study raises to 17 the number of known RSPO4 mutations and further expands the molecular repertoire causing hypo/anonychia. The c.353G>A emerges as a recurrent change with a possible founder effect in the Pakistani population. Our findings suggest that c.3G>A is not sufficient to cause the disorder and could be considered a polymorphism.",

    "title": "Unveiling distribution patterns of freshwater phytoplankton by a next generation sequencing based approach.",
    "abstract": "The recognition and discrimination of phytoplankton species is one of the foundations of freshwater biodiversity research and environmental monitoring. This step is frequently a bottleneck in the analytical chain from sampling to data analysis and subsequent environmental status evaluation. Here we present phytoplankton diversity data from 49 lakes including three seasonal surveys assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S ribosomal RNA chloroplast and cyanobacterial gene amplicons and also compare part of these datasets with identification based on morphology. Direct comparison of NGS to microscopic data from three time-series showed that NGS was able to capture the seasonality in phytoplankton succession as observed by microscopy. Still, the PCR-based approach was only semi-quantitative, and detailed NGS and microscopy taxa lists had only low taxonomic correspondence. This is probably due to, both, methodological constraints and current discrepancies in taxonomic frameworks. Discrepancies included Euglenophyta and Heterokonta that were scarce in the NGS but frequently detected by microscopy and Cyanobacteria that were in general more abundant and classified with high resolution by NGS. A deep-branching taxonomically unclassified cluster was frequently detected by NGS but could not be linked to any group identified by microscopy. NGS derived phytoplankton composition differed significantly among lakes with different trophic status, showing that our approach can resolve phytoplankton communities at a level relevant for ecosystem management. The high reproducibility and potential for standardization and parallelization makes our NGS approach an excellent candidate for simultaneous monitoring of prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton in inland waters.",

Here we report two siblings with mitochondrial disease, due to compound heterozygous mutations in the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, presenting with severe neurological symptoms but normal mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle biopsies and cultured skin fibroblasts.\n\nWhole exome sequencing on genomic DNA samples from both subjects and their parents identified two compound heterozygous variants c.833T>G (p.Val278Gly) and c.938A>T (p.Lys313Met) in the WARS2 gene as potential disease-causing variants. We generated patient-derived neuroepithelial stem cells and modeled the disease in yeast and Drosophila melanogaster to confirm pathogenicity.\n\nBiochemical analysis of patient-derived neuroepithelial stem cells revealed a mild combined complex I and IV defect, while modeling the disease in yeast demonstrated that the reported aminoacylation defect severely affects respiration and viability. Furthermore, silencing of wild type WARS2 in Drosophila melanogaster showed that a partial defect in aminoacylation is enough to cause lethality.\n\nOur results establish the identified WARS2 variants as disease-causing and highlight the benefit of including human neuronal models, when investigating mutations specifically affecting the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "In development, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been suggested to provide a cellular memory to maintain multipotency but also stabilize cell fate decisions and direct lineage restriction. In this study, we set out to characterize changes in DNA methylation and gene expression during granulopoiesis using 4 distinct cell populations ranging from the oligopotent common myeloid progenitor stage to terminally differentiated neutrophils. We observed that differentially methylated sites (DMSs) generally show decreased methylation during granulopoiesis. Methylation appears to change at specific differentiation stages and overlap with changes in transcription and activity of key hematopoietic transcription factors. DMSs were preferentially located in areas distal to CpG islands and shores. Also, DMSs were overrepresented in enhancer elements and enriched in enhancers that become active during differentiation. Overall, this study depicts in detail the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during granulopoiesis and supports the role of DNA methylation as a regulatory mechanism in blood cell differentiation.",

    "title": "The complete genome of Blastobotrys (Arxula) adeninivorans LS3 - a yeast of biotechnological interest.",
    "abstract": "The industrially important yeast Blastobotrys (Arxula) adeninivorans is an asexual hemiascomycete phylogenetically very distant from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its unusual metabolic flexibility allows it to use a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources, while being thermotolerant, xerotolerant and osmotolerant.\n\nThe sequencing of strain LS3 revealed that the nuclear genome of A. adeninivorans is 11.8 Mb long and consists of four chromosomes with regional centromeres. Its closest sequenced relative is Yarrowia lipolytica, although mean conservation of orthologs is low. With 914 introns within 6116 genes, A. adeninivorans is one of the most intron-rich hemiascomycetes sequenced to date. Several large species-specific families appear to result from multiple rounds of segmental duplications of tandem gene arrays, a novel mechanism not yet described in yeasts. An analysis of the genome and its transcriptome revealed enzymes with biotechnological potential, such as two extracellular tannases (Atan1p and Atan2p) of the tannic-acid catabolic route, and a new pathway for the assimilation of n-butanol via butyric aldehyde and butyric acid.\n\nThe high-quality genome of this species that diverged early in Saccharomycotina will allow further fundamental studies on comparative genomics, evolution and phylogenetics. Protein components of different pathways for carbon and nitrogen source utilization were identified, which so far has remained unexplored in yeast, offering clues for further biotechnological developments. In the course of identifying alternative microorganisms for biotechnological interest, A. adeninivorans has already proved its strengthened competitiveness as a promising cell factory for many more applications.",

    "title": "Using transcriptomics to improve butanol tolerance of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.",
    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are emerging as promising hosts for production of advanced biofuels such as n-butanol and alkanes. However, cyanobacteria suffer from the same product inhibition problems as those that plague other microbial biofuel hosts. High concentrations of butanol severely reduce growth, and even small amounts can negatively affect metabolic processes. An understanding of how cyanobacteria are affected by their biofuel product can enable identification of engineering strategies for improving their tolerance. Here we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to assess the transcriptome response of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 to two concentrations of exogenous n-butanol. Approximately 80 transcripts were differentially expressed at 40 mg/liter butanol, and 280 transcripts were different at 1 g/liter butanol. Our results suggest a compromised cell membrane, impaired photosynthetic electron transport, and reduced biosynthesis. Accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) scaled with butanol concentration. Using the physiology and transcriptomics data, we selected several genes for overexpression in an attempt to improve butanol tolerance. We found that overexpression of several proteins, notably, the small heat shock protein HspA, improved tolerance to butanol. Transcriptomics-guided engineering created more solvent-tolerant cyanobacteria strains that could be the foundation for a more productive biofuel host.",

    "abstract": "Larvae of the Chinese oak silkmoth (Antheraea pernyi) are often affected by AVD (A. pernyi vomiting disease), whose causative agent has long been suspected to be a virus. In an unrelated project we discovered a novel positive sense single-stranded RNA virus that could reproduce AVD symptoms upon injection into healthy A. pernyi larvae. The genome of this virus is 10,163 nucleotides long, has a natural poly-A tail, and contains a single, large open reading frame flanked at the 5' and 3' ends by untranslated regions containing putative structural elements for replication and translation of the virus genome. The open reading frame is predicted to encode a 3036 amino acid polyprotein with four viral structural proteins (VP1-VP4) located in the N-terminal end and the non-structural proteins, including a helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and 3C-protease, located in the C-terminal end of the polyprotein. Putative 3C-protease and autolytic cleavage sites were identified for processing the polyprotein into functional units. The genome organization, amino acid sequence and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the virus is a novel species of the genus Iflavirus, with the proposed name of Antheraea pernyi Iflavirus (ApIV).",

    "title": "A comprehensive comparison of RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis from reads to differential gene expression and cross-comparison with microarrays: a case study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",
    "abstract": "RNA-seq, has recently become an attractive method of choice in the studies of transcriptomes, promising several advantages compared with microarrays. In this study, we sought to assess the contribution of the different analytical steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data generated with the Illumina platform, and to perform a cross-platform comparison based on the results obtained through Affymetrix microarray. As a case study for our work we, used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK 113-7D, grown under two different conditions (batch and chemostat). Here, we asses the influence of genetic variation on the estimation of gene expression level using three different aligners for read-mapping (Gsnap, Stampy and TopHat) on S288c genome, the capabilities of five different statistical methods to detect differential gene expression (baySeq, Cuffdiff, DESeq, edgeR and NOISeq) and we explored the consistency between RNA-seq analysis using reference genome and de novo assembly approach. High reproducibility among biological replicates (correlation≥0.99) and high consistency between the two platforms for analysis of gene expression levels (correlation≥0.91) are reported. The results from differential gene expression identification derived from the different statistical methods, as well as their integrated analysis results based on gene ontology annotation are in good agreement. Overall, our study provides a useful and comprehensive comparison between the two platforms (RNA-seq and microrrays) for gene expression analysis and addresses the contribution of the different steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data.",

The extent to which lesion-induced transcriptional mutagenesis (TM) influences protein function and its contribution to the development of disease is not well understood. In this study, the impact of O6-methylguanine on the transcription fidelity of p53 and the subsequent effects on the protein’s function as a regulator of cell death and cell-cycle arrest were examined in human cells. Levels of TM were determined by RNA-sequencing. In cells with active DNA repair, misincorporation of uridine opposite the lesion occurred in 0.14% of the transcripts and increased to 14.7% when repair by alkylguanine–DNA alkyltransferase was compromised. Expression of the dominant-negative p53 R248W mutant due to TM significantly reduced the transactivation of several established p53 target genes that mediate the tumor-suppressor function, including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This resulted in deregulated signaling through the retinoblastoma protein and loss of G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint function. In addition, we observed impaired activation of apoptosis coupled to the reduction of the tumor-suppressor functions of p53. Taking these findings together, this work provides evidence that TM can induce phenotypic changes in mammalian cells that have important implications for the role of TM in tumorigenesis.",

    "title": "Integrative genome and transcriptome analyses reveal two distinct types of ring chromosome in soft tissue sarcomas.",
    "abstract": "Gene amplification is a common phenomenon in malignant neoplasms of all types. One mechanism behind increased gene copy number is the formation of ring chromosomes. Such structures are mitotically unstable and during tumor progression they accumulate material from many different parts of the genome. Hence, their content varies considerably between and within tumors. Partly due to this extensive variation, the genetic content of many ring-containing tumors remains poorly characterized. Ring chromosomes are particularly prevalent in specific subtypes of sarcoma. Here, we have combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), global genomic copy number and gene expression data on ring-containing soft tissue sarcomas and show that they harbor two fundamentally different types of ring chromosome: MDM2-positive and MDM2-negative rings. While the former are often found in an otherwise normal chromosome complement, the latter seem to arise in the context of general chromosomal instability. In line with this, sarcomas with MDM2-negative rings commonly show complete loss of either CDKN2A or RB1 -both known to be important for genome integrity. Sarcomas with MDM2-positive rings instead show co-amplification of a variety of potential driver oncogenes. More than 100 different genes were found to be involved, many of which are known to induce cell growth, promote proliferation or inhibit apoptosis. Several of the amplified and overexpressed genes constitute potential drug targets.",

    "title": "The invasion phenotypes of glioblastoma depend on plastic and reprogrammable cell states.",
    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer. It causes death mainly by local invasion via several routes, including infiltration of white matter tracts and penetration of perivascular spaces. However, the pathways that mediate these invasion routes are only partly known. Here, we conduct an integrative study to identify cell states and central drivers of route-specific invasion in GBM. Combining single-cell profiling and spatial protein detection in patient-derived xenograft models and clinical tumor samples, we demonstrate a close association between the differentiation state of GBM cells and their choice of invasion route. Computational modeling identifies ANXA1 as a driver of perivascular involvement in GBM cells with mesenchymal differentiation and the transcription factors RFX4 and HOPX as orchestrators of growth and differentiation in diffusely invading GBM cells. Ablation of these targets in tumor cells alters their invasion route, redistributes the cell states, and extends survival in xenografted mice. Our results define a close association between GBM cell differentiation states and invasion routes, identify functional biomarkers of route-specific invasion, and point toward targeted modulation of specific invasive cell states as a therapeutic strategy in GBM.",

    "title": "Diversification of molecularly defined myenteric neuron classes revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Autonomous regulation of the intestine requires the combined activity of functionally distinct neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS). However, the variety of enteric neuron types and how they emerge during development remain largely unknown. Here, we define a molecular taxonomy of 12 enteric neuron classes within the myenteric plexus of the mouse small intestine using single-cell RNA sequencing. We present cell-cell communication features and histochemical markers for motor neurons, sensory neurons and interneurons, together with transgenic tools for class-specific targeting. Transcriptome analysis of the embryonic ENS uncovers a novel principle of neuronal diversification, where two neuron classes arise through a binary neurogenic branching and all other identities emerge through subsequent postmitotic differentiation. We identify generic and class-specific transcriptional regulators and functionally connect Pbx3 to a postmitotic fate transition. Our results offer a conceptual and molecular resource for dissecting ENS circuits and predicting key regulators for directed differentiation of distinct enteric neuron classes.",

    "title": "The transporter ABCB7 is a mediator of the phenotype of acquired refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts.",
    "abstract": "Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is characterized by mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT) accumulation and markedly suppressed expression of the iron transporter ABCB7. To test the hypothesis that ABCB7 is a key mediator of ineffective erythropoiesis of RARS, we modulated its expression in hematopoietic cells. ABCB7 up and downregulation did not influence growth and survival of K562 cells. In normal bone marrow, ABCB7 downregulation reduced erythroid differentiation, growth and colony formation, and resulted in a gene expression pattern similar to that observed in intermediate RARS erythroblasts, and in the accumulation of FTMT. Importantly, forced ABCB7 expression restored erythroid colony growth and decreased FTMT expression level in RARS CD34+ marrow cells. Mutations in the SF3B1 gene, a core component of the RNA splicing machinery, were recently identified in a high proportion of patients with RARS and 11 of the 13 RARS patients in this study carried this mutation. Interestingly, ABCB7 exon usage differed between normal bone marrow and RARS, as well as within the RARS cohort. In addition, SF3B1 silencing resulted in downregulation of ABCB7 in K562 cells undergoing erythroid differentiation. Our findings support that ABCB7 is implicated in the phenotype of acquired RARS and suggest a relation between SF3B1 mutations and ABCB7 downregulation.",

    "title": "Evaluation of genetic demultiplexing of single-cell sequencing data from model species.",
    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (sc-seq) provides a species agnostic tool to study cellular processes. However, these technologies are expensive and require sufficient cell quantities and biological replicates to avoid artifactual results. An option to address these problems is pooling cells from multiple individuals into one sc-seq library. In humans, genotype-based computational separation (i.e., demultiplexing) of pooled sc-seq samples is common. This approach would be instrumental for studying non-isogenic model organisms. We set out to determine whether genotype-based demultiplexing could be more broadly applied among species ranging from zebrafish to non-human primates. Using such non-isogenic species, we benchmark genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq datasets against various ground truths. We demonstrate that genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq samples can be used with confidence in several non-isogenic model organisms and uncover limitations of this method. Importantly, the only genomic resource required for this approach is sc-seq data and a de novo transcriptome. The incorporation of pooling into sc-seq study designs will decrease cost while simultaneously increasing the reproducibility and experimental options in non-isogenic model organisms.",

    "title": "A cell fitness selection model for neuronal survival during development",
    "abstract": "Developmental cell death plays an important role in the construction of functional neural circuits. In vertebrates, the canonical view proposes a selection of the surviving neurons through stochastic competition for target-derived neurotrophic signals, implying an equal potential for neurons to compete. Here we show an alternative cell fitness selection of neurons that is defined by a specific neuronal heterogeneity code. Proprioceptive sensory neurons that will undergo cell death and those that will survive exhibit different molecular signatures that are regulated by retinoic acid and transcription factors, and are independent of the target and neurotrophins. These molecular features are genetically encoded, representing two distinct subgroups of neurons with contrasted functional maturation states and survival outcome. Thus, in this model, a heterogeneous code of intrinsic cell fitness in neighboring neurons provides differential competitive advantage resulting in the selection of cells with higher capacity to survive and functionally integrate into neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the normal state of human tissue transcriptome profiles is essential for recognizing tissue disease states and identifying disease markers. Recently, the Human Protein Atlas and the FANTOM5 consortium have each published extensive transcriptome data for human samples using Illumina-sequenced RNA-Seq and Heliscope-sequenced CAGE. Here, we report on the first large-scale complex tissue transcriptome comparison between full-length versus 5'-capped mRNA sequencing data. Overall gene expression correlation was high between the 22 corresponding tissues analyzed (R > 0.8). For genes ubiquitously expressed across all tissues, the two data sets showed high genome-wide correlation (91% agreement), with differences observed for a small number of individual genes indicating the need to update their gene models. Among the identified single-tissue enriched genes, up to 75% showed consensus of 7-fold enrichment in the same tissue in both methods, while another 17% exhibited multiple tissue enrichment and/or high expression variety in the other data set, likely dependent on the cell type proportions included in each tissue sample. Our results show that RNA-Seq and CAGE tissue transcriptome data sets are highly complementary for improving gene model annotations and highlight biological complexities within tissue transcriptomes. Furthermore, integration with image-based protein expression data is highly advantageous for understanding expression specificities for many genes.",

    "title": "Spatial Transcriptomics in a Case of Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma Reveals Clone-Specific Dysregulation of Genes Regulating Extracellular Matrix in the Invading Front.",
    "abstract": "Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is recognized by its ability to invade the tumor capsule and blood vessels, although the exact molecular signals orchestrating this phenotype remain elusive. In this study, the spatial transcriptional landscape of an FTC is detailed with comparisons between the invasive front and histologically indolent central core tumor areas. The Visium spatial gene expression platform allowed us to interrogate and visualize the whole transcriptome in 2D across formalin-fixated paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Four different 6 × 6 mm areas of an FTC were scrutinized, including regions with capsular and vascular invasion, capsule-near area without invasion, and a central core area of the tumor. Following successful capturing and sequencing, several expressional clusters were identified with regional variation. Most notably, invasive tumor cell clusters were significantly over-expressing genes associated with pathways interacting with the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Subsets of these genes (POSTN and DPYSL3) were additionally validated using immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of follicular thyroid tumors showing a clear gradient pattern from the core to the periphery of the tumor. Moreover, the reconstruction of the evolutionary tree identified the invasive clones as late events in follicular thyroid tumorigenesis. To our knowledge, this is one of the first 2D global transcriptional mappings of FTC using this platform to date. Invasive FTC clones develop in a stepwise fashion and display significant dysregulation of genes associated with the ECM and EMT - thus highlighting important molecular crosstalk for further investigations.",
