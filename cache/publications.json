    "title": "Ancient DNA from a 2700-year-old goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) supports gazelle hunting in Iron Age Central Asia.",
    "abstract": "Central Asia has been an important region connecting the different parts of Eurasia throughout history and prehistory, with large states developing in this region during the Iron Age. Archaeogenomics is a powerful addition to the zooarchaeological toolkit for understanding the relation of these societies to animals. Here, we present the genetic identification of a goitered gazelle specimen (Gazella subgutturosa) at the site Gazimulla-Tepa, in modern-day Uzbekistan, supporting hunting of the species in the region during the Iron Age. The sample was directly radiocarbon dated to 2724-2439 calBP. A phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome places the individual into the modern variation of G. subgutturosa. Our data do represent both the first ancient DNA and the first nuclear DNA sequences of this species. The lack of genomic resources available for this gazelle and related species prevented us from performing a more in-depth analysis of the nuclear sequences generated. Therefore, we are making our sequence data available to the research community to facilitate other research of this nowadays threatened species which has been subject to human hunting for several millennia across its entire range on the Asian continent.",

    "title": "Higher host plant specialization of root-associated endophytes than mycorrhizal fungi along an arctic elevational gradient.",
    "abstract": "How community-level specialization differs among groups of organisms, and changes along environmental gradients, is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms influencing ecological communities. In this paper, we investigate the specialization of root-associated fungi for plant species, asking whether the level of specialization varies with elevation. For this, we applied DNA barcoding based on the ITS region to root samples of five plant species equivalently sampled along an elevational gradient at a high arctic site. To assess whether the level of specialization changed with elevation and whether the observed patterns varied between mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi, we applied a joint species distribution modeling approach. Our results show that host plant specialization is not environmentally constrained in arctic root-associated fungal communities, since there was no evidence for changing specialization with elevation, even if the composition of root-associated fungal communities changed substantially. However, the level of specialization for particular plant species differed among fungal groups, root-associated endophytic fungal communities being highly specialized on particular host species, and mycorrhizal fungi showing almost no signs of specialization. Our results suggest that plant identity affects associated mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi differently, highlighting the need of considering both endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi when studying specialization in root-associated fungal communities.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal barrier is composed of a complex cell network defining highly compartmentalized and specialized structures. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to define how the transcriptomic landscape is spatially organized in the steady state and healing murine colon. At steady state conditions, we demonstrate a previously unappreciated molecular regionalization of the colon, which dramatically changes during mucosal healing. Here, we identified spatially-organized transcriptional programs defining compartmentalized mucosal healing, and regions with dominant wired pathways. Furthermore, we showed that decreased p53 activation defined areas with increased presence of proliferating epithelial stem cells. Finally, we mapped transcriptomics modules associated with human diseases demonstrating the translational potential of our dataset. Overall, we provide a publicly available resource defining principles of transcriptomic regionalization of the colon during mucosal healing and a framework to develop and progress further hypotheses.",

    "title": "Distinct temporal changes in host cell lncRNA expression during the course of an adenovirus infection.",
    "abstract": "The deregulation of cellular long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression during a human adenovirus infection was studied by deep sequencing. Expression of lncRNAs increased substantially following the progression of the infection. Among 645 significantly expressed lncRNAs, the expression of 398 was changed more than 2-fold. More than 80% of them were up-regulated and 80% of them were detected during the late phase. Based on the genomic locations of the deregulated lncRNAs in relation to known mRNAs and miRNAs, they were predicted to be involved in growth, structure, apoptosis and wound healing in the early phase, cell proliferation in the intermediate phase and protein synthesis, modification and transport in the late phase. The most significant functions of cellular RNA-binding proteins, previously shown to interact with the deregulated lncRNAs identified here, are involved in RNA splicing, nuclear export and translation events. We hypothesize that adenoviruses exploit the lncRNA network to optimize their reproduction.",

    "title": "Fermentative Yeast Diversity at the Northern Range Limit of Their Oak Tree Hosts.",
    "abstract": "Fermentative yeasts play important roles in both ecological and industrial processes, but their distribution and abundance in natural environments are not well understood. We investigated the diversity of yeasts at the northern range limit of their oak tree hosts (Quercus spp.) in Sweden, and identified climatic and ecological conditions governing their distribution. Yeasts were isolated from bark samples from 28 forests and identified to the species level using DNA metabarcoding. Most communities were dominated by species in the Saccharomycetaceae family, especially by species of Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces and Pichia. Each genus showed a distinct latitudinal and longitudinal distribution, and both temperature and precipitation metrics predicted significant variation in their abundance. Consistent with this, laboratory assays revealed significant effects of temperature on the growth of strains collected from different longitudes and latitudes. We found that older trees harbour more diverse and more balanced fermentative yeast communities with more evenly distributed species abundances. Communities across trees were more similar when sharing a common dominant species. This work provides a baseline for future studies on the impact of climate change on the fermentative yeast biodiversity of temperate forests in northern latitudes and contributes to a growing collection of wild isolates for potential biotechnological applications.",

    "title": "Genetic fine mapping and genomic annotation defines causal mechanisms at type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci.",
    "abstract": "We performed fine mapping of 39 established type 2 diabetes (T2D) loci in 27,206 cases and 57,574 controls of European ancestry. We identified 49 distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression. Our study demonstrates how integration of genetic and genomic information can define molecular mechanisms through which variants underlying association signals exert their effects on disease.",

    "abstract": "Climate shapes the distribution of plant-associated microbes such as mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi. However, the role of climate in plant pathogen community assembly is less understood. Here, we explored the role of climate in the assembly of Phytophthora communities at >250 sites along a latitudinal gradient from Spain to northern Sweden and an altitudinal gradient from the Spanish Pyrenees to lowland areas. Communities were detected by ITS sequencing of river filtrates. Mediation analysis supported the role of climate in the biogeography of Phytophthora and ruled out other environmental factors such as geography or tree diversity. Comparisons of functional and species diversity showed that environmental filtering dominated over competitive exclusion in Europe. Temperature and precipitation acted as environmental filters at different extremes of the gradients. In northern regions, winter temperatures acted as an environmental filter on Phytophthora community assembly, selecting species adapted to survive low minimum temperatures. In southern latitudes, a hot dry climate was the main environmental filter, resulting in communities dominated by drought-tolerant Phytophthora species with thick oospore walls, a high optimum temperature for growth, and a high maximum temperature limit for growth. By taking a community ecology approach, we show that the establishment of Phytophthora plant pathogens in Europe is mainly restricted by cold temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The patterns of reproductive timing and senescence vary within and across species owing to differences in reproductive strategies, but our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of such variation is incomplete. This is perhaps particularly true for sex differences. We investigated the evolution of sex-specific gene expression associated with life history divergence in replicated populations of the seed beetle Acanthoscelides obtectus, experimentally evolving under (E)arly or (L)ate life reproduction for >200 generations which has resulted in strongly divergent life histories. We detected 1,646 genes that were differentially expressed in E and L lines, consistent with a highly polygenic basis of life history evolution. Only 30% of differentially expressed genes were similarly affected in males and females. The evolution of long life was associated with significantly reduced sex differences in expression, especially in non-reproductive tissues. The expression differences were overall more pronounced in females, in accordance with their greater phenotypic divergence in lifespan. Functional enrichment analysis revealed differences between E and L beetles in gene categories previously implicated in aging, such as mitochondrial function and defense response. The results show that divergent life history evolution can be associated with profound changes in gene expression that alter the transcriptome in a sex-specific way, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of aging in each sex.",

    "title": "Expanding the genetic toolbox of Rhodotorula toruloides by identification and validation of six novel promoters induced or repressed under nitrogen starvation.",
    "abstract": "The non-conventional yeast Rhodotorula toruloides is an emerging host organism in biotechnology by merit of its natural capacity to accumulate high levels of carotenoids and intracellular storage lipids from a variety of carbon sources. While the number of genetic engineering strategies that employ R. toruloides is increasing, the lack of genetic tools available for modification of this yeast is still limiting strain development. For instance, several strong, constitutive R. toruloides promoters have been characterized, but to date, only five inducible promoters have been identified. Although nitrogen-limited cultivation conditions are commonly used to induce lipid accumulation in this yeast, no promoters regulated by nitrogen starvation have been described for R. toruloides.\n\nIn this study, we used a combination of genomics and transcriptomics methods to identify novel R. toruloides promoter sequences that are either inducible or repressible by nitrogen starvation. RNA sequencing was used to assess gene expression in the recently isolated strain R. toruloides BOT-A2 during exponential growth and during nitrogen starvation, when cultivated with either glucose or xylose as the carbon source. The genome of BOT-A2 was sequenced using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing and annotated with support of the RNAseq data. Differential expression analysis was used to identify genes with a |log2 fold change|≥ 2 when comparing their expression during nitrogen depletion to that during exponential growth. The promoter regions from 16 of these genes were evaluated for their ability to drive the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene. Three promoters that were clearly upregulated under nitrogen starvation and three that were downregulated were selected and further characterized. One promoter, derived from gene RTBOTA2_003877, was found to function like an on-off switch, as it was only upregulated under full nitrogen depletion and downregulated in the presence of the nitrogen source.\n\nSix new R. toruloides promoters that were either upregulated or downregulated under nitrogen-starvation were identified. These substantially contribute to the available promoters when engineering this organism and are foreseen to be particularly useful for future engineering strategies requiring specific regulation of target genes in accordance with nitrogen availability.",

    "title": "Unlocking novel T cell-based immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma through neoantigen-driven T cell receptor isolation.",
    "abstract": "Tumour-infiltrating T cells can mediate both antitumour immunity and promote tumour progression by creating an immunosuppressive environment. This dual role is especially relevant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterised by a unique microenvironment and limited success with current immunotherapy.\n\nWe evaluated T cell responses in patients with advanced HCC by analysing tumours, liver flushes and liver-draining lymph nodes, to understand whether reactive T cell populations could be identified despite the immunosuppressive environment.\n\nT cells isolated from clinical samples were tested for reactivity against predicted neoantigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to evaluate the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of antigen-experienced T cells. Neoantigen-reactive T cells expressing 4-1BB were isolated and characterised through T-cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing.\n\nBioinformatic analysis identified 542 candidate neoantigens from seven patients. Of these, 78 neoantigens, along with 11 hotspot targets from HCC driver oncogenes, were selected for ex vivo T cell stimulation. Reactivity was confirmed in co-culture assays for 14 targets, with most reactive T cells derived from liver flushes and lymph nodes. Liver flush-derived T cells exhibited central memory and effector memory CD4+ with cytotoxic effector profiles. In contrast, tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an exhausted profile were primarily identified in the draining lymph nodes.\n\nThese findings offer valuable insights into the functional profiles of neoantigen-reactive T cells within and surrounding the HCC microenvironment. T cells isolated from liver flushes and tumour-draining lymph nodes may serve as a promising source of reactive T cells and TCRs for further use in immunotherapy for HCC.",

    "title": "Adenosine kinase deficiency disrupts the methionine cycle and causes hypermethioninemia, encephalopathy, and abnormal liver function.",
    "abstract": "Four inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are known to cause hypermethioninemia by directly interfering with the methionine cycle. Hypermethioninemia is occasionally discovered incidentally, but it is often disregarded as an unspecific finding, particularly if liver disease is involved. In many individuals the hypermethioninemia resolves without further deterioration, but it can also represent an early sign of a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. Further investigation of unclear hypermethioninemia is therefore important. We studied two siblings affected by severe developmental delay and liver dysfunction. Biochemical analysis revealed increased plasma levels of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) but normal or mildly elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, indicating a block in the methionine cycle. We excluded S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) deficiency, which causes a similar biochemical phenotype, by using genetic and biochemical techniques and hypothesized that there was a functional block in the SAHH enzyme as a result of a recessive mutation in a different gene. Using exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous c.902C>A (p.Ala301Glu) missense mutation in the adenosine kinase gene (ADK), the function of which fits perfectly with this hypothesis. Increased urinary adenosine excretion confirmed ADK deficiency in the siblings. Four additional individuals from two unrelated families with a similar presentation were identified and shown to have a homozygous c.653A>C (p.Asp218Ala) and c.38G>A (p.Gly13Glu) mutation, respectively, in the same gene. All three missense mutations were deleterious, as shown by activity measurements on recombinant enzymes. ADK deficiency is a previously undescribed, severe IEM shedding light on a functional link between the methionine cycle and adenosine metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma, the most prevalent extracranial pediatric solid tumor, arises from neural crest progeny cells. It exhibits substantial developmental plasticity and intratumoral heterogeneity, leading to survival rates below 50% in high-risk cases. The regulatory mechanisms underlying this plasticity remain largely elusive. In this integrative study, we used single-cell MultiOmics from a mouse spontaneous tumor model and spatial transcriptomics from human patient samples to dissect the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes that govern developmental states in neuroblastoma. We identified developmental intermediate states in high-risk neuroblastomas critical for malignant transitions and uncovered extensive epigenetic priming with latent capacity for diverse state transitions. Furthermore, we mapped enhancer gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) and tumor microenvironments sustaining these aggressive states. State transitions and malignancy could be interfered with by targeting transcription factors controlling the eGRNs.",

    "title": "GWAS-identified loci for coronary heart disease are associated with intima-media thickness and plaque presence at the carotid artery bulb.",
    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have so far identified 45 loci that are robustly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in data from adult men and women of European descent.\n\nTo examine whether the CHD-associated loci are associated with measures of atherosclerosis in data from up to 9582 individuals of European ancestry.\n\nForty-five SNPs representing the CHD-associated loci were genotyped in middle-aged to elderly individuals of European descent from four independent population-based studies (IMPROVE, MDC-CC, ULSAM and PIVUS). Intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured by external B-mode ultrasonography at the far wall of the bulb (sinus) and common carotid artery. Plaque presence was defined as a maximal IMT of the bulb >1.5 mm. We meta-analysed single-SNP associations across the four studies, and combined them in a genetic predisposition score. We subsequently examined the association of the genetic predisposition score with prevalent CHD and the three indices of atherosclerosis, adjusting for sex, age and Framingham risk factors.\n\nAs anticipated, the genetic predisposition score was associated with prevalent CHD, with each additional risk allele increasing the odds of disease by 5.5% (p = 4.1 × 10(-6)). Moreover, each additional CHD-risk allele across the 45 loci was associated with a 0.24% increase in IMT (p = 4.0 × 10(-3)), and with a 2.8% increased odds of plaque presence (p = 7.4 × 10(-6)) at the far wall of the bulb. The genetic predisposition score was not associated with IMT of the common carotid artery (p = 0.47).\n\nOur results suggest that the association between the 45 previously identified loci and CHD at least partly acts through atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Brachyspira spp. colonize the intestines of some mammalian and avian species and show different degrees of enteropathogenicity. Brachyspira intermedia can cause production losses in chickens and strain PWS/AT now becomes the fourth genome to be completed in the genus Brachyspira.\n\n15 classes of unique and shared genes were analyzed in B. intermedia, B. murdochii, B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli. The largest number of unique genes was found in B. intermedia and B. murdochii. This indicates the presence of larger pan-genomes. In general, hypothetical protein annotations are overrepresented among the unique genes. A 3.2 kb plasmid was found in B. intermedia strain PWS/AT. The plasmid was also present in the B. murdochii strain but not in nine other Brachyspira isolates. Within the Brachyspira genomes, genes had been translocated and also frequently switched between leading and lagging strands, a process that can be followed by different AT-skews in the third positions of synonymous codons. We also found evidence that bacteriophages were being remodeled and genes incorporated into them.\n\nThe accessory gene pool shapes species-specific traits. It is also influenced by reductive genome evolution and horizontal gene transfer. Gene-transfer events can cross both species and genus boundaries and bacteriophages appear to play an important role in this process. A mechanism for horizontal gene transfer appears to be gene translocations leading to remodeling of bacteriophages in combination with broad tropism.",

    "title": "Host genotype interacts with aerial spore communities and influences the needle mycobiome of Norway spruce.",
    "abstract": "The factors shaping the composition of the tree mycobiome are still under investigation. We tested the effects of host genotype, site, host phenotypic traits, and air fungal spore communities on the assembly of the fungi inhabiting Norway spruce needles. We used Norway spruce clones and spore traps within the collection sites and characterized both needle and air mycobiome communities by high-throughput sequencing of the ITS2 region. The composition of the needle mycobiome differed between Norway spruce clones, and clones with high genetic similarity had a more similar mycobiome. The needle mycobiome also varied across sites and was associated with the composition of the local air mycobiome and climate. Phenotypic traits such as diameter at breast height or crown health influenced the needle mycobiome to a lesser extent than host genotype and air mycobiome. Altogether, our results suggest that the needle mycobiome is mainly driven by the host genotype in combination with the composition of the local air spore communities. Our work highlights the role of host intraspecific variation in shaping the mycobiome of trees and provides new insights on the ecological processes structuring fungal communities inhabiting woody plants.",

    "title": "Microbial functional genes are driven by gradients in sediment stoichiometry, oxygen, and salinity across the Baltic benthic ecosystem.",
    "abstract": "Microorganisms in the seafloor use a wide range of metabolic processes, which are coupled to the presence of functional genes within their genomes. Aquatic environments are heterogenous and often characterized by natural physiochemical gradients that structure these microbial communities potentially changing the diversity of functional genes and its associated metabolic processes. In this study, we investigated spatial variability and how environmental variables structure the diversity and composition of benthic functional genes and metabolic pathways across various fundamental environmental gradients. We analyzed metagenomic data from sediment samples, measured related abiotic data (e.g., salinity, oxygen and carbon content), covering 59 stations spanning 1,145 km across the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe composition of genes and microbial communities were mainly structured by salinity plus oxygen, and the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio for specific metabolic pathways related to nutrient transport and carbon metabolism. Multivariate analyses indicated that the compositional change in functional genes was more prominent across environmental gradients compared to changes in microbial taxonomy even at genus level, and indicate functional diversity adaptation to local environments. Oxygen deficient areas (i.e., dead zones) were more different in gene composition when compared to oxic sediments.\n\nThis study highlights how benthic functional genes are structured over spatial distances and by environmental gradients and resource availability, and suggests that changes in, e.g., oxygenation, salinity, and carbon plus nitrogen content will influence functional metabolic pathways in benthic habitats.

    "title": "A comprehensive 1,000 Genomes-based genome-wide association meta-analysis of coronary artery disease.",
    "abstract": "Existing knowledge of genetic variants affecting risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is largely based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of common SNPs. Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of ∼185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 < MAF < 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate causal genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in FUS and TARDBP cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the precise mechanisms of selective motor neuron degeneration remain unresolved. To address if pathomechanisms are shared across mutations and related to either gain- or loss-of-function, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing across isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron types, harbouring FUS P525L, FUS R495X, TARDBP M337V mutations or FUS knockout. Transcriptional changes were far more pronounced in motor neurons than interneurons. About 20% of uniquely dysregulated motor neuron transcripts were shared across FUS mutations, half from gain-of-function. Most indicated mitochondrial impairments, with attenuated pathways shared with mutant TARDBP M337V as well as C9orf72-ALS patient motor neurons. Mitochondrial motility was impaired in ALS motor axons, even with nuclear localized FUS mutants, demonstrating shared toxic gain-of-function mechanisms across FUS- and TARDBP-ALS, uncoupled from protein mislocalization. These early mitochondrial dysfunctions unique to motor neurons may affect survival and represent therapeutic targets in ALS.",

    "abstract": "The WNT10A protein is critical for the development of ectodermal appendages. Variants in the WNT10A gene may be associated with a spectrum of ectodermal abnormalities including extensive tooth agenesis.\n\nIn seven patients with severe tooth agenesis we identified anomalies in primary dentition and additional ectodermal symptoms, and assessed WNT10A mutations by genetic analysis.\n\nInvestigation of primary dentition revealed peg-shaped crowns of primary mandibular incisors and three individuals had agenesis of at least two primary teeth. The permanent dentition was severely affected in all individuals with a mean of 21 missing teeth. Primary teeth were most often present in positions were succedaneous teeth were missing. Furthermore, most existing molars had taurodontism. Light, brittle or coarse hair was reported in all seven individuals, hyperhidrosis of palms and soles in six individuals and nail anomalies in two individuals. The anomalies in primary dentition preceded most of the additional ectodermal symptoms. Genetic analysis revealed that all seven individuals were homozygous or compound heterozygous for WNT10A mutations resulting in C107X, E222X and F228I.\n\nWe conclude that tooth agenesis and/or peg-shaped crowns of primary mandibular incisors, severe oligodontia of permanent dentition as well as ectodermal symptoms of varying severity may be predictors of bi-allelic WNT10A mutations of importance for diagnosis, counselling and follow-up.",

    "title": "Post-zygotic and inter-individual structural genetic variation in a presumptive enhancer element of the locus between the IL10Rβ and IFNAR1 genes.",
    "abstract": "Although historically considered as junk-DNA, tandemly repeated sequence motifs can affect human phenotype. For example, variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) with embedded enhancers have been shown to regulate gene transcription. The post-zygotic variation is the presence of genetically distinct populations of cells in an individual derived from a single zygote, and this is an understudied aspect of genome biology. We report somatically variable VNTR with sequence properties of an enhancer, located upstream of IFNAR1. Initially, SNP genotyping of 63 monozygotic twin pairs and multiple tissues from 21 breast cancer patients suggested a frequent post-zygotic mosaicism. The VNTR displayed a repeated 32 bp core motif in the center of the repeat, which was flanked by similar variable motifs. A total of 14 alleles were characterized based on combinations of segments, which showed post-zygotic and inter-individual variation, with up to 6 alleles in a single subject. Somatic variation occurred in ∼24% of cases. In this hypervariable region, we found a clustering of transcription factor binding sites with strongest sequence similarity to mouse Foxg1 transcription factor binding motif. This study describes a VNTR with sequence properties of an enhancer that displays post-zygotic and inter-individual genetic variation. This element is within a locus containing four related cytokine receptors: IFNAR2, IL10Rβ, IFNAR1 and IFNGR2, and we hypothesize that it might function in transcriptional regulation of several genes in this cluster. Our findings add another level of complexity to the variation among VNTR-based enhancers. Further work may unveil the normal function of this VNTR in transcriptional control and its possible involvement in diseases connected with these receptors, such as autoimmune conditions and cancer.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate a sudden increase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cases primarily in one maternity ward at the Center for Children's and Women's Health at Linköping University Hospital, Sweden. Approximately 300 individuals including patients, their family members, and healthcare workers were screened for MRSA. The antibiotic susceptibility was tested and isolates polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for the mecA gene were spa typed. Isolates with the same antibiogram and spa type were further whole genome sequenced. Compliance to current cleaning and hygiene routines was also controlled, and environmental samples collected. The results showed that a total of 13 individuals were involved in the outbreak. It was caused by a t386 MRSA strain (ST-1, NCBI-accession AB505628) with additional resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin. All cases were epidemiologically connected to the index patient, who had recently emigrated from a high-endemic area for MRSA. With improved cleaning and better compliance to basic hygiene routines, no further cases were reported. This study demonstrates how rapid an MRSA strain can disseminate in a ward with susceptible patients and insufficient cleaning and hygiene. For a better control of MRSA, clinical cultures and screening samples need to be obtained early and more extensively than according to the current recommendations.",

    "title": "Trophozoite fitness dictates the intestinal epithelial cell response to Giardia intestinalis infection.",
    "abstract": "Giardia intestinalis is a non-invasive, protozoan parasite infecting the upper small intestine of most mammals. Symptomatic infections cause the diarrhoeal disease giardiasis in humans and animals, but at least half of the infections are asymptomatic. However, the molecular underpinnings of these different outcomes of the infection are still poorly defined. Here, we studied the early transcriptional response to G. intestinalis trophozoites, the disease-causing life-cycle stage, in human enteroid-derived, 2-dimensional intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) monolayers. Trophozoites preconditioned in media that maximise parasite fitness triggered only neglectable inflammatory transcription in the IECs during the first hours of co-incubation. By sharp contrast, \"non-fit\" or lysed trophozoites induced a vigorous IEC transcriptional response, including high up-regulation of many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, \"fit\" trophozoites could even suppress the stimulatory effect of lysed trophozoites in mixed infections, suggesting active G. intestinalis suppression of the IEC response. By dual-species RNA-sequencing, we defined the IEC and G. intestinalis gene expression programs associated with these differential outcomes of the infection. Taken together, our results inform on how G. intestinalis infection can lead to such highly variable effects on the host, and pinpoints trophozoite fitness as a key determinant of the IEC response to this common parasite.",

    "title": "The Mitogenome of Norway Spruce and a Reappraisal of Mitochondrial Recombination in Plants.",
    "abstract": "Plant mitogenomes can be difficult to assemble because they are structurally dynamic and prone to intergenomic DNA transfers, leading to the unusual situation where an organelle genome is far outnumbered by its nuclear counterparts. As a result, comparative mitogenome studies are in their infancy and some key aspects of genome evolution are still known mainly from pregenomic, qualitative methods. To help address these limitations, we combined machine learning and in silico enrichment of mitochondrial-like long reads to assemble the bacterial-sized mitogenome of Norway spruce (Pinaceae: Picea abies). We conducted comparative analyses of repeat abundance, intergenomic transfers, substitution and rearrangement rates, and estimated repeat-by-repeat homologous recombination rates. Prompted by our discovery of highly recombinogenic small repeats in P. abies, we assessed the genomic support for the prevailing hypothesis that intramolecular recombination is predominantly driven by repeat length, with larger repeats facilitating DNA exchange more readily. Overall, we found mixed support for this view: Recombination dynamics were heterogeneous across vascular plants and highly active small repeats (ca. 200 bp) were present in about one-third of studied mitogenomes. As in previous studies, we did not observe any robust relationships among commonly studied genome attributes, but we identify variation in recombination rates as a underinvestigated source of plant mitogenome diversity.",

    "abstract": "Structural variations, including copy number variations (CNVs), affect around 20 million bases in the human genome and are common causes of rare conditions. CNVs are rarely investigated in complex disease research because most CNVs are not targeted on the genotyping arrays or the reference panels for genetic imputation. In this study, we characterize CNVs in a Swedish cohort (N = 1,021) using short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) and use long-read WGS for validation in a sub-cohort (N = 15), and explore their effect on 438 plasma proteins. We detected 184,182 polymorphic CNVs and identified 15 CNVs to be associated with 16 proteins (p<8.22×10-10). Of these, five CNVs could be perfectly validated using long-read sequencing, including a CNV which was associated to measurements of the osteoclast-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (OSCAR) and located upstream of OSCAR, a gene important for bone health. Two other CNVs were identified to be clusters of many short repetitive elements and another represented a complex rearrangement including an inversion. Our findings provide insights into the structure of common CNVs and their effects on the plasma proteome, and highlights the importance of investigating common CNVs, also in relation to complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that the adverse health effects of obesity differ between genetically and environmentally influenced obesity. We examined differences in the association between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) between individuals with a genetically predicted low, medium, or high body mass index (BMI).\r\n\r\nWe used cohort data from Swedish twins born before 1959 who had BMI measured between the ages of 40-64 years (midlife) or at the age of 65 years or later (late-life), or both, and prospective CVD information from nationwide register linkage through 2016. A polygenic score for BMI (PGSBMI) was used to define genetically predicted BMI. Individuals missing BMI or covariate data, or diagnosed with CVD at first BMI measure, were excluded, leaving an analysis sample of 17,988 individuals. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between BMI category and incident CVD, stratified by the PGSBMI. Co-twin control models were applied to adjust for genetic influences not captured by the PGSBMI.\r\n\r\nBetween 1984 and 2010, the 17,988 participants were enrolled in sub-studies of the Swedish Twin Registry. Midlife obesity was associated with a higher risk of CVD across all PGSBMI categories, but the association was stronger with genetically predicted lower BMI (hazard ratio from 1.55 to 2.08 for those with high and low PGSBMI, respectively). Within monozygotic twin pairs, the association did not differ by genetically predicted BMI, indicating genetic confounding not captured by the PGSBMI. Results were similar when obesity was measured in late-life, but suffered from low power.\r\n\r\nObesity was associated with CVD regardless of PGSBMI category, but obesity influenced by genetic predisposition (genetically predicted high BMI) was less harmful than obesity influenced by environmental factors (obesity despite genetically predicted low BMI). However, additional genetic factors, not captured by the PGSBMI, still influence the associations.\r\n\r\nThe Strategic Research Program in Epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet; Loo and Hans Osterman's Foundation; Foundation for Geriatric Diseases at Karolinska Institutet; the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare; the Swedish Research Council; and the National Institutes of Health.",

    "title": "Smoking affects epigenetic ageing of lung bronchoalveolar lavage cells in Multiple Sclerosis.",
    "abstract": "A compelling body of evidence implicates cigarette smoking and lung inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) susceptibility and progression. Previous studies have reported epigenetic age (DNAm age) acceleration in blood immune cells and in glial cells of people with MS (pwMS) compared to healthy controls (HC).\n\nWe aimed to examine biological ageing in lung immune cells in the context of MS and smoking.\n\nWe analyzed age acceleration residuals in lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, constituted of mainly alveolar macrophages, from 17 pwMS and 22 HC in relation to smoking using eight DNA methylation-based clocks, namely AltumAge, Horvath, GrimAge, PhenoAge, Zhang, SkinBlood, Hannum, Monocyte clock as well as two RNA-based clocks, which capture different aspects of biological ageing.\n\nAfter adjustment for covariates, five epigenetic clocks showed significant differences between the groups. Four of them, Horvath (Padj = 0.028), GrimAge (Padj = 4.28 × 10-7), SkinBlood (Padj = 0.001) and Zhang (Padj = 0.02), uncovered the sole effect of smoking on ageing estimates, irrespective of the clinical group. The Horvath, SkinBlood and Zhang clocks showed a negative impact of smoking while GrimAge detected smoking-associated age acceleration in BAL cells. On the contrary, the AltumAge clock revealed differences between pwMS and HC and indicated that, in the absence of smoking, BAL cells of pwMS were epigenetically 5.4 years older compared to HC (Padj = 0.028). Smoking further affected epigenetic ageing in BAL cells of pwMS specifically as non-smoking pwMS exhibited a 10.2-year AltumAge acceleration compared to pwMS smokers (Padj = 0.0049). Of note, blood-derived monocytes did not show any MS-specific or smoking-related AltumAge differences. The difference between BAL cells of pwMS smokers and non-smokers was attributable to the differential methylation of 114 AltumAge-CpGs (Padj < 0.05) affecting genes involved in innate immune processes such as cytokine production, defense response and cell motility. These changes functionally translated into transcriptional differences in BAL cells between pwMS smokers and non-smokers.\n\nBAL cells of pwMS display inflammation-related and smoking-dependent changes associated to epigenetic ageing captured by the AltumAge clock. Future studies examining potential confounders, such as the distribution of distinct BAL myeloid cell types in pwMS compared to control individuals in relation to smoking may clarify the varying performance and DNAm age estimations among epigenetic clocks.",

    "title": "Widespread non-additive and interaction effects within HLA loci modulate the risk of autoimmune diseases.",
    "abstract": "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes confer substantial risk for autoimmune diseases on a log-additive scale. Here we speculated that differences in autoantigen-binding repertoires between a heterozygote's two expressed HLA variants might result in additional non-additive risk effects. We tested the non-additive disease contributions of classical HLA alleles in patients and matched controls for five common autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (ncases = 5,337), type 1 diabetes (T1D; ncases = 5,567), psoriasis vulgaris (ncases = 3,089), idiopathic achalasia (ncases = 727) and celiac disease (ncases = 11,115). In four of the five diseases, we observed highly significant, non-additive dominance effects (rheumatoid arthritis, P = 2.5 × 10(-12); T1D, P = 2.4 × 10(-10); psoriasis, P = 5.9 × 10(-6); celiac disease, P = 1.2 × 10(-87)). In three of these diseases, the non-additive dominance effects were explained by interactions between specific classical HLA alleles (rheumatoid arthritis, P = 1.8 × 10(-3); T1D, P = 8.6 × 10(-27); celiac disease, P = 6.0 × 10(-100)). These interactions generally increased disease risk and explained moderate but significant fractions of phenotypic variance (rheumatoid arthritis, 1.4%; T1D, 4.0%; celiac disease, 4.1%) beyond a simple additive model.",

    "title": "Association of TMEM18 variants with BMI and waist circumference in children and correlation of mRNA expression in the PFC with body weight in rats.",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have shown a strong association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the near vicinity of the TMEM18 gene. The effects of the TMEM18-associated variants are more readily observed in children. TMEM18 encodes a 3TM protein, which locates to the nuclear membrane. The functional context of TMEM18 and the effects of its associated variants are as of yet undetermined. To further explore the effects of near-TMEM18 variants, we have genotyped two TMEM18-associated SNPs, rs6548238 and rs4854344, in a cohort of 2352 Greek children (Healthy Growth Study). Included in this study are data on anthropomorphic traits body weight, BMI z-score and waist circumference. Also included are dietary energy and macronutrient intake as measured via 24-h recall interviews. Major alleles of rs6548238 and rs4854344 were significantly associated with an increased risk of obesity (odds ratio = 1.489 (1.161-1.910) and 1.494 (1.165-1.917), respectively), and positively correlated to body weight (P = 0.017, P = 0.010) and waist circumference (P = 0.003, P = 0.003). An association to energy and macronutrient intake was not observed in this cohort. We also correlated food intake and body weight in a food choice model in rats to Tmem18 expression in central regions involved in feeding behavior. We observed a strong positive correlation between TMEM18 expression and body weight in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (r = 0.5694, P = 0.0003) indicating a potential role for TMEM18 in higher functions related to feeding involving the PFC.",

    "abstract": "The demographic history of East-Central Europe after the Neolithic period remains poorly explored, despite this region being on the confluence of various ecological zones and cultural entities. Here, the descendants of societies associated with steppe pastoralists form Early Bronze Age were followed by Middle Bronze Age populations displaying unique characteristics. Particularly, the predominance of collective burials, the scale of which, was previously seen only in the Neolithic. The extent to which this re-emergence of older traditions is a result of genetic shift or social changes in the MBA is a subject of debate. Here by analysing 91 newly generated genomes from Bronze Age individuals from present Poland and Ukraine, we discovered that Middle Bronze Age populations were formed by an additional admixture event involving a population with relatively high proportions of genetic component associated with European hunter-gatherers and that their social structure was based on, primarily patrilocal, multigenerational kin-groups.",

    "title": "Decoding a substantial set of samples in parallel by massive sequencing.",
    "abstract": "There has been a dramatic increase of throughput of sequenced bases in the last years but sequencing a multitude of samples in parallel has not yet developed equally. Here we present a novel strategy where the combination of two tags is used to link sequencing reads back to their origins from a pool of samples. By incorporating the tags in two steps sample-handling complexity is lowered by nearly 100 times compared to conventional indexing protocols. In addition, the method described here enables accurate identification and typing of thousands of samples in parallel. In this study the system was designed to test 4992 samples using only 122 tags. To prove the concept of the two-tagging method, the highly polymorphic 2(nd) exon of DLA-DRB1 in dogs and wolves was sequenced using the 454 GS FLX Titanium Chemistry. By requiring a minimum sequence depth of 20 reads per sample, 94% of the successfully amplified samples were genotyped. In addition, the method allowed digital detection of chimeric fragments. These results demonstrate that it is possible to sequence thousands of samples in parallel without complex pooling patterns or primer combinations. Furthermore, the method is highly scalable as only a limited number of additional tags leads to substantial increase of the sample size.",

    "title": "Genetic diversity patterns in farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations using genome-wide SNP and haplotype data.",
    "abstract": "Rainbow trout is one of the most popular aquaculture species worldwide, with a long history of domestication. However, limited information exists about the genetic diversity of farmed rainbow trout populations globally, with most available reports relying on low-throughput genotyping technologies. Notably, no information exists about the genetic diversity status of farmed rainbow trout in Sweden. Double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing was performed on more than 500 broodfish from two leading producers in Sweden and from the country's national breeding program. Following the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genetic diversity was studied by using either individual SNPs (n = 8680; one SNP retained per 300 bp sequence reads) or through SNP haplotypes (n = 20 558; all SNPs retained in 300 bp sequence reads). Similar amounts of genetic diversity were found amongst the three populations when individual SNPs were used. Furthermore, principal component analysis and discriminant analysis of principal components suggested two genetic clusters with the two industry populations grouped together. Genetic differentiation based on the FST fixation index was ~0.01 between the industry populations and ~0.05 when those were compared with the breeding program. Preliminary estimates of effective population size (Ne ) and inbreeding (based on runs of homozygosity; FROH ) were similar amongst the three populations (Ne ≈ 50-80; median FROH ≈ 0.11). Finally, the haplotype-based analysis suggested that animals from the breeding program had higher shared coancestry levels than those from the other two populations. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the genetic diversity and structure of Sweden's three main farmed rainbow trout populations, which could guide their future management.",

    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence show that modern humans interbred with archaic Denisovans. Here, we report an account of shared demographic history between Australasians and Denisovans distinctively in Island Southeast Asia. Our analyses are based on ∼2.3 million genotypes from 118 ethnic groups of the Philippines, including 25 diverse self-identified Negrito populations, along with high-coverage genomes of Australopapuans and Ayta Magbukon Negritos. We show that Ayta Magbukon possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world-∼30%-40% greater than that of Australians and Papuans-consistent with an independent admixture event into Negritos from Denisovans. Together with the recently described Homo luzonensis, we suggest that there were multiple archaic species that inhabited the Philippines prior to the arrival of modern humans and that these archaic groups may have been genetically related. Altogether, our findings unveil a complex intertwined history of modern and archaic humans in the Asia-Pacific region, where distinct Islander Denisovan populations differentially admixed with incoming Australasians across multiple locations and at various points in time.",

    "title": "Abundantly expressed class of noncoding RNAs conserved through the multicellular evolution of dictyostelid social amoebas.",
    "abstract": "Aggregative multicellularity has evolved multiple times in diverse groups of eukaryotes, exemplified by the well-studied development of dictyostelid social amoebas, for example, Dictyostelium discoideum However, it is still poorly understood why multicellularity emerged in these amoebas while the majority of other members of Amoebozoa are unicellular. Previously, a novel type of noncoding RNA, Class I RNAs, was identified in D. discoideum and shown to be important for normal multicellular development. Here, we investigated Class I RNA evolution and its connection to multicellular development. We identified a large number of new Class I RNA genes by constructing a covariance model combined with a scoring system based on conserved upstream sequences. Multiple genes were predicted in representatives of each major group of Dictyostelia and expression analysis confirmed that our search approach identifies expressed Class I RNA genes with high accuracy and sensitivity and that the RNAs are developmentally regulated. Further studies showed that Class I RNAs are ubiquitous in Dictyostelia and share highly conserved structure and sequence motifs. In addition, Class I RNA genes appear to be unique to dictyostelid social amoebas because they could not be identified in outgroup genomes, including their closest known relatives. Our results show that Class I RNA is an ancient class of ncRNAs, likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of Dictyostelia dating back at least 600 million years. Based on previous functional analyses and the presented evolutionary investigation, we hypothesize that Class I RNAs were involved in evolution of multicellularity in Dictyostelia.",

    "title": "Genetic variance estimation with imputed variants finds negligible missing heritability for human height and body mass index.",
    "abstract": "We propose a method (GREML-LDMS) to estimate heritability for human complex traits in unrelated individuals using whole-genome sequencing data. We demonstrate using simulations based on whole-genome sequencing data that ∼97% and ∼68% of variation at common and rare variants, respectively, can be captured by imputation. Using the GREML-LDMS method, we estimate from 44,126 unrelated individuals that all ∼17 million imputed variants explain 56% (standard error (s.e.) = 2.3%) of variance for height and 27% (s.e. = 2.5%) of variance for body mass index (BMI), and we find evidence that height- and BMI-associated variants have been under natural selection. Considering the imperfect tagging of imputation and potential overestimation of heritability from previous family-based studies, heritability is likely to be 60-70% for height and 30-40% for BMI. Therefore, the missing heritability is small for both traits. For further discovery of genes associated with complex traits, a study design with SNP arrays followed by imputation is more cost-effective than whole-genome sequencing at current prices.",

Methanoculleus bourgensis strain MAB1 belongs to the order Methanomicrobiales, family Methanomicrobiaceae, within the phylum Euryarchaeota. The genome shows a total size of 2,859,299 bp encoding 3450 predicted protein-encoding genes, of which only 1472 (43 %) have been assigned tentative functions. The genome encodes further 44 tRNA genes and three rRNA genes (5S, 16S and 23S rRNA). This study presents assembling and annotation features as well as genomic traits related to ammonia tolerance and methanogenesis.",

    "title": "Sex-Specific Effects of Adiponectin on Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and Incident Cardiovascular Disease.",
    "abstract": "Plasma adiponectin levels have previously been inversely associated with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. In this study, we used a sex-stratified Mendelian randomization approach to investigate whether adiponectin has a causal protective influence on IMT.\n\nBaseline plasma adiponectin concentration was tested for association with baseline IMT, IMT progression over 30 months, and occurrence of cardiovascular events within 3 years in 3430 participants (women, n=1777; men, n=1653) with high cardiovascular risk but no prevalent disease. Plasma adiponectin levels were inversely associated with baseline mean bifurcation IMT after adjustment for established risk factors (β=-0.018, P<0.001) in men but not in women (β=-0.006, P=0.185; P for interaction=0.061). Adiponectin levels were inversely associated with progression of mean common carotid IMT in men (β=-0.0022, P=0.047), whereas no association was seen in women (0.0007, P=0.475; P for interaction=0.018). Moreover, we observed that adiponectin levels were inversely associated with coronary events in women (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87) but not in men (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25). A gene score of adiponectin-raising alleles in 6 loci, reported recently in a large multi-ethnic meta-analysis, was inversely associated with baseline mean bifurcation IMT in men (β=-0.0008, P=0.004) but not in women (β=-0.0003, P=0.522; P for interaction=0.007).\n\nThis report provides some evidence for adiponectin protecting against atherosclerosis, with effects being confined to men; however, compared with established cardiovascular risk factors, the effect of plasma adiponectin was modest. Further investigation involving mechanistic studies is warranted.",

    "abstract": "In the Boreal region, extreme seasonal variations in day-night length expose communities to dynamic light and temperature fluctuations. Freshwater bacterioplankton, representing key ecosystem components, faces climate-driven shifts; yet the fixed day-length patterns determined by latitude underscore the importance of studying light's role in predicting ecosystem responses. We investigated bacterial community composition in a brown peat bog and a clear oligotrophic lake across seasons with contrasting light regimes: the summer solstice (> 20 h of daylight) and the autumn equinox (equal day-night length). Using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA transcripts, alongside measurements of physicochemical parameters, organic matter characterisation and dissolved carbon dioxide and methane gas measurements, we found no diel cycling in the lake during either period or in the peat bog near the summer solstice. However, the structure of bacterial peat bog communities exhibited cyclic changes over diel cycles at the autumn equinox. Twelve amplicon sequence variants, including both phototrophic and heterotrophic taxa, increased in abundance at all measured morning sampling times. These findings provide valuable insights into the diel patterns of boreal lentic habitats and their bacterioplankton communities, highlighting the absence of diel fluctuations in some systems and seasons, while revealing cyclic dynamics in others, driven by conditionally rare taxa.",

    "title": "Long-term warming modulates diversity, vertical structuring of microbial communities, and sulfate reduction in coastal Baltic Sea sediments.",
    "abstract": "Coastal waters such as those found in the Baltic Sea already suffer from anthropogenic related problems including increased algal blooming and hypoxia while ongoing and future climate change will likely worsen these effects. Microbial communities in sediments play a crucial role in the marine energy- and nutrient cycling, and how they are affected by climate change and shape the environment in the future is of great interest. The aims of this study were to investigate potential effects of prolonged warming on microbial community composition and nutrient cycling including sulfate reduction in surface (∼0.5 cm) to deeper sediments (∼ 24 cm). To investigate this, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed, and sulfate concentrations were measured and compared between sediments in a heated bay (which has been used as a cooling water outlet from a nearby nuclear power plant for approximately 50 years) and a nearby but unaffected control bay. The results showed variation in overall microbial diversity according to sediment depth and higher sulfate flux in the heated bay compared to the control bay. A difference in vertical community structure reflected increased relative abundances of sulfur oxidizing- and sulfate reducing bacteria along with a higher proportion of archaea, such as Bathyarchaeota, in the heated compared to the control bay. This was particularly evident closer to the sediment surface, indicating a compression of geochemical zones in the heated bay. These results corroborate findings in previous studies and additionally point to an amplified effect of prolonged warming deeper in the sediment, which could result in elevated concentrations of toxic compounds and greenhouse gases closer to the sediment surface.",

    "title": "A CRISPR homing screen finds a chloroquine resistance transporter-like protein of the Plasmodium oocyst essential for mosquito transmission of malaria.",
    "abstract": "Genetic screens with barcoded PlasmoGEM vectors have identified thousands of Plasmodium berghei gene functions in haploid blood stages, gametocytes and liver stages. However, the formation of diploid cells by fertilisation has hindered similar research on the parasites' mosquito stages. In this study, we develop a scalable genetic system that uses barcoded gene targeting vectors equipped with a CRISPR-mediated homing mechanism to generate homozygous loss-of-function mutants after one parent introduces a modified allele into the zygote. To achieve this, we use vectors additionally expressing a target gene specific gRNA. When integrated into one of the parental alleles it directs Cas9 to the intact allele after fertilisation, leading to its disruption. This homing strategy is 90% effective at generating homozygous gene editing of a fluorescence-tagged reporter locus in the oocyst. A pilot screen identifies PBANKA_0916000 as a chloroquine resistance transporter-like protein (CRTL) essential for oocyst growth and sporogony, pointing to an unexpected importance for malaria transmission of the poorly understood digestive vacuole of the oocyst that contains hemozoin granules. Homing screens provide a method for the systematic discovery of malaria transmission genes whose first essential functions are after fertilisation in the bloodmeal, enabling their potential as targets for transmission-blocking interventions to be assessed.",

    "title": "Evolutionary genetics of canine respiratory coronavirus and recent introduction into Swedish dogs.",
    "abstract": "Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has been identified as a causative agent of canine infectious respiratory disease, an upper respiratory infection affecting dogs. The epidemiology is currently opaque, with an unclear understanding of global prevalence, pathology, and genetic characteristics. In this study, Swedish privately-owned dogs with characteristic signs of canine infectious respiratory disease (n = 88) were screened for CRCoV and 13 positive samples (14.7%, 8.4-23.7% [95% confidence interval (CI)]) were further sequenced. Sequenced Swedish CRCoV isolates were highly similar despite being detected in dogs living in geographically distant locations and sampled across 3 years (2013-2015). This is due to a single introduction into Swedish dogs in approximately 2010, as inferred by time structured phylogeny. Unlike other CRCoVs, there was no evidence of recombination in Swedish CRCoV viruses, further supporting a single introduction. Finally, there were low levels of polymorphisms, in the spike genes. Overall, we demonstrate that there is little diversity of CRCoV which is endemic in Swedish dogs.",

    "abstract": "Although cardinal cortical interneuron identity is established upon cell-cycle exit, it remains unclear whether specific interneuron subtypes are pre-established, and if so, how their identity is maintained prior to circuit integration. We conditionally removed Sox6 (Sox6-cKO) in migrating somatostatin (Sst+) interneurons and assessed the effects on their mature identity. In adolescent mice, five of eight molecular Sst+ subtypes were nearly absent in the Sox6-cKO cortex without a reduction in cell number. Sox6-cKO cells displayed electrophysiological maturity and expressed genes enriched within the broad class of Sst+ interneurons. Furthermore, we could infer subtype identity prior to cortical integration (embryonic day 18.5), suggesting that the loss in subtype was due to disrupted subtype maintenance. Conversely, Sox6 removal at postnatal day 7 did not disrupt marker expression in the mature cortex. Therefore, Sox6 is necessary during migration for maintenance of Sst+ subtype identity, indicating that subtype maintenance requires active transcriptional programs.",

    "title": "Next Generation Plasma Proteomics Identifies High-Precision Biomarker Candidates for Ovarian Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer among women and has a 5-year survival of only 30-50%. The survival is close to 90% for patients in stage I but only 20% for patients in stage IV. The presently available biomarkers have insufficient sensitivity and specificity for early detection and there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers.\n\nWe employed the Explore PEA technology for high-precision analysis of 1463 plasma proteins and conducted a discovery and replication study using two clinical cohorts of previously untreated patients with benign or malignant ovarian tumours (N = 111 and N = 37).\n\nThe discovery analysis identified 32 proteins that had significantly higher levels in malignant cases as compared to benign diagnoses, and for 28 of these, the association was replicated in the second cohort. Multivariate modelling identified three highly accurate models based on 4 to 7 proteins each for separating benign tumours from early-stage and/or late-stage ovarian cancers, all with AUCs above 0.96 in the replication cohort. We also developed a model for separating the early-stage from the late-stage achieving an AUC of 0.81 in the replication cohort. These models were based on eleven proteins in total (ALPP, CXCL8, DPY30, IL6, IL12, KRT19, PAEP, TSPAN1, SIGLEC5, VTCN1, and WFDC2), notably without MUCIN-16. The majority of the associated proteins have been connected to ovarian cancer but not identified as potential biomarkers.\n\nThe results show the ability of using high-precision proteomics for the identification of novel plasma protein biomarker candidates for the early detection of ovarian cancer.",

    "title": "Illuminating Genetic Mysteries of the Dead Sea Scrolls.",
    "abstract": "The discovery of the 2,000-year-old Dead Sea Scrolls had an incomparable impact on the historical understanding of Judaism and Christianity. \"Piecing together\" scroll fragments is like solving jigsaw puzzles with an unknown number of missing parts. We used the fact that most scrolls are made from animal skins to \"fingerprint\" pieces based on DNA sequences. Genetic sorting of the scrolls illuminates their textual relationship and historical significance. Disambiguating the contested relationship between Jeremiah fragments supplies evidence that some scrolls were brought to the Qumran caves from elsewhere; significantly, they demonstrate that divergent versions of Jeremiah circulated in parallel throughout Israel (ancient Judea). Similarly, patterns discovered in non-biblical scrolls, particularly the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, suggest that the Qumran scrolls represent the broader cultural milieu of the period. Finally, genetic analysis divorces debated fragments from the Qumran scrolls. Our study demonstrates that interdisciplinary approaches enrich the scholar's toolkit.",

    "title": "Using Genetic Variants to Assess the Relationship Between Circulating Lipids and Type 2 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "The effects of dyslipidemia on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits are not clear. We used regression models and 140 lipid-associated genetic variants to estimate associations between circulating HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides and T2D and related traits. Each genetic test was corrected for effects of variants on the other two lipid types and surrogates of adiposity. We used the largest data sets available: 34,840 T2D case and 114,981 control subjects from the DIAGRAM (DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis) consortium and up to 133,010 individuals without diabetes for insulin secretion and sensitivity from the MAGIC (Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium) and GENESIS (GENEticS of Insulin Sensitivity) studies. Eight of 21 associations between groups of variants and diabetes traits were significant at the nominal level, including those between genetically determined lower HDL-C (β = -0.12, P = 0.03) and T2D and genetically determined lower LDL-C (β = -0.21, P = 5 × 10(-6)) and T2D. Although some of these may represent causal associations, we discuss why caution must be used when using Mendelian randomization in the context of circulating lipid levels and diabetes traits. In conclusion, we found evidence of links between genetic variants associated with lipids and T2D, but deeper knowledge of the underlying genetic mechanisms of specific lipid variants is needed before drawing definite conclusions about causality based on Mendelian randomization methodology.",

    "title": "Comprehensive analysis of microRNA expression in regionalized human neural progenitor cells reveals microRNA-10 as a caudalizing factor.",
    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating multiple processes during brain development in various species. However, the function of miRNAs in human brain development remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression of regionalized neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells and human foetal brain. We found miR-92b-3p and miR-130b-5p to be specifically associated with neural progenitors and several miRNAs that display both age-specific and region-specific expression patterns. Among these miRNAs, we identified miR-10 to be specifically expressed in the human hindbrain and spinal cord, while being absent from rostral regions. We found that miR-10 regulates a large number of genes enriched for functions including transcription, actin cytoskeleton and ephrin receptor signalling. When overexpressed, miR-10 influences caudalization of human neural progenitor cells. Together, these data confirm a role for miRNAs in establishing different human neural progenitor populations. This dataset also provides a comprehensive resource for future studies investigating the functional role of different miRNAs in human brain development.",
