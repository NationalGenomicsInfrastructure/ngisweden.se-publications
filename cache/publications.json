    "title": "Single-cell RNAseq and longitudinal proteomic analysis of a novel semi-spontaneous urothelial cancer model reveals tumor cell heterogeneity and pretumoral urine protein alterations.",
    "abstract": "Bladder cancer, one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, remains hard to classify due to a staggering molecular complexity. Despite a plethora of diagnostic tools and therapies, it is hard to outline the key steps leading up to the transition from high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Carcinogen-induced murine models can recapitulate urothelial carcinogenesis and natural anti-tumor immunity. Herein, we have developed and profiled a novel model of progressive NMIBC based on 10 weeks of OH-BBN exposure in hepatocyte growth factor/cyclin dependent kinase 4 (R24C) (Hgf-Cdk4R24C) mice. The profiling of the model was performed by histology grading, single cell transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, while the derivation of a tumorigenic cell line was validated and used to assess in vivo anti-tumor effects in response to immunotherapy. Established NMIBC was present in females at 10 weeks post OH-BBN exposure while neoplasia was not as advanced in male mice, however all mice progressed to MIBC. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an intratumoral heterogeneity also described in the human disease trajectory. Moreover, although immune activation biomarkers were elevated in urine during carcinogen exposure, anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) monotherapy did not prevent tumor progression. Furthermore, anti-PD1 immunotherapy did not control the growth of subcutaneous tumors formed by the newly derived urothelial cancer cell line. However, treatment with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) significantly decreased tumor volume, but only in females. In conclusion, the molecular map of this novel preclinical model of bladder cancer provides an opportunity to further investigate pharmacological therapies ahead with regards to both targeted drugs and immunotherapies to improve the strategies of how we should tackle the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment in urothelial bladder cancer to improve responses rates in the clinic.",

    "title": "Triazole fungicides induce adipogenesis and repress osteoblastogenesis in zebrafish.",
    "abstract": "Triazoles are a major group of azole fungicides commonly used in agriculture, and veterinary and human medicine. Maternal exposure to certain triazole antifungal medication causes congenital malformations, including skeletal malformations. We hypothesized that triazoles used as pesticides in agriculture also pose a risk of causing skeletal malformations in developing embryos. In this study, teratogenic effects of three commonly used triazoles, cyproconazole, paclobutrazol, and triadimenol, were investigated in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Exposure to the triazole fungicides caused bone and cartilage malformations in developing zebrafish larvae. Data from whole-embryo transcriptomics with cyproconazole suggested that exposure to this compound induces adipogenesis while repressing skeletal development. Confirming this finding, the expression of selected bone and cartilage marker genes were significantly downregulated with triazoles exposure as determined by quantitative PCR. The expression of selected adipogenic genes was upregulated by the triazoles. Furthermore, exposure to each of the three triazoles induced adipogenesis and lipid droplet formation in vitro in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells. In vivo in zebrafish larvae, cyproconazole exposure caused lipid accumulation. These results suggest that exposure to triazoles promotes adipogenesis at the expense of skeletal development, and thus they expand the chemical group of bona fide bone to fat switchers.",

    "title": "Enhancer mutations modulate the severity of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.",
    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and many patients are still treated with classical chemotherapy. The unselective nature of chemotherapy often results in severe myelosuppression. Previous studies showed that protein-coding mutations could not fully explain the predisposition to myelosuppression. Here, we investigate the possible role of enhancer mutations in myelosuppression susceptibility. We produced transcriptome and promoter-interaction maps (using HiCap) of three blood stem-like cell lines treated with carboplatin or gemcitabine. Taking advantage of publicly available enhancer datasets, we validated HiCap results in silico and in living cells using epigenetic CRISPR technology. We also developed a network approach for interactome analysis and detection of differentially interacting genes. Differential interaction analysis provided additional information on relevant genes and pathways for myelosuppression compared with differential gene expression analysis at the bulk level. Moreover, we showed that enhancers of differentially interacting genes are highly enriched for variants associated with differing levels of myelosuppression. Altogether, our work represents a prominent example of integrative transcriptome and gene regulatory datasets analysis for the functional annotation of noncoding mutations.",

    "title": "Male-transmitted transgenerational effects of the herbicide linuron on DNA methylation profiles in Xenopus tropicalis brain and testis.",
    "abstract": "The herbicide linuron can cause endocrine disrupting effects in Xenopus tropicalis frogs, including offspring that were never exposed to the contaminant. The mechanisms by which these effects are transmitted across generations need to be further investigated. Here, we examined transgenerational alterations of brain and testis DNA methylation profiles paternally inherited from grandfathers developmentally exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of linuron. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) revealed numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in brain (3060 DMRs) and testis (2551 DMRs) of the adult male F2 generation. Key genes in the brain involved in somatotropic (igfbp4) and thyrotropic signaling (dio1 and tg) were differentially methylated and correlated with phenotypical alterations in body size, weight, hind limb length and plasma glucose levels, indicating that these methylation changes could be potential mediators of the transgenerational effects of linuron. Testis DMRs were found in genes essential for spermatogenesis, meiosis and germ cell development (piwil1, spo11 and tdrd9) and their methylation levels were correlated with the number of germ cells nests per seminiferous tubule, an endpoint of disrupted spermatogenesis. DMRs were also identified in several genes central for the machinery that regulates the epigenetic landscape including DNA methylation (dnmt3a and mbd2) and histone acetylation (hdac8, ep300, elp3, kat5 and kat14), which may at least partly drive the linuron-induced transgenerational effects. The results from this genome-wide DNA methylation profiling contribute to better understanding of potential transgenerational epigenetic inheritance mechanisms in amphibians.",

    "abstract": "Exome sequencing has become more and more affordable and the technique has emerged as an important diagnostic tool for monogenic disorders at early stages of investigations, in particular when clinical information is limited or unspecific as well as in cases of genetic heterogeneity.\r\n\r\nWe identified a consanguineous Pakistani family segregating an autosomal recessive phenotype characterized by muscular hypertrophy, mild mental retardation and skeletal abnormalities. The available clinical information was incomplete and we applied whole exome sequencing in an affected family member for the identification of candidate gene variants.\r\n\r\nExome sequencing identified a previously unreported homozygous mutation in the acceptor splice site of intron 5 in the BSCL2 gene (c.574-2A > G). Expression analysis revealed that the mutation was associated with skipping of exon 6. BSCL2 mutations are associated with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy and a clinical re-evaluation of affected individuals confirmed the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nExome sequencing is a powerful technique for the identification of candidate gene variants in Mendelian traits. We applied this technique on a single individual affected by a likely autosomal recessive disorder without access to complete clinical details. A homozygous and truncating mutation was identified in the BSCL2 gene suggesting congenital generalized lipodystrophy. Incomplete phenotypic delineations are frequent limiting factors in search for a diagnosis and may lead to inappropriate care and follow-up. Our study exemplifies exome sequencing as a powerful diagnostic tool in Mendelian disorders that may complement missing clinical information and accelerate clinical diagnosis.",

    "title": "Genetic Causes and Genomic Consequences of Breakdown of Distyly in Linum trigynum.",
    "abstract": "Distyly is an iconic floral polymorphism governed by a supergene, which promotes efficient pollen transfer and outcrossing through reciprocal differences in the position of sexual organs in flowers, often coupled with heteromorphic self-incompatibility. Distyly has evolved convergently in multiple flowering plant lineages, but has also broken down repeatedly, often resulting in homostylous, self-compatible populations with elevated rates of self-fertilization. Here, we aimed to study the genetic causes and genomic consequences of the shift to homostyly in Linum trigynum, which is closely related to distylous Linum tenue. Building on a high-quality genome assembly, we show that L. trigynum harbors a genomic region homologous to the dominant haplotype of the distyly supergene conferring long stamens and short styles in L. tenue, suggesting that loss of distyly first occurred in a short-styled individual. In contrast to homostylous Primula and Fagopyrum, L. trigynum harbors no fixed loss-of-function mutations in coding sequences of S-linked distyly candidate genes. Instead, floral gene expression analyses and controlled crosses suggest that mutations downregulating the S-linked LtWDR-44 candidate gene for male self-incompatibility and/or anther height could underlie homostyly and self-compatibility in L. trigynum. Population genomic analyses of 224 whole-genome sequences further demonstrate that L. trigynum is highly self-fertilizing, exhibits significantly lower genetic diversity genome-wide, and is experiencing relaxed purifying selection and less frequent positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations relative to L. tenue. Our analyses shed light on the loss of distyly in L. trigynum, and advance our understanding of a common evolutionary transition in flowering plants.",

    "title": "Phthalate esters in baltic lagoons: Spatial distribution, ecological risks, and novel insights into their fate using transcriptomics.",
    "abstract": "Plasticizers such as phthalate esters (PAEs) are organic compounds widely used in various consumer and industrial products, raising strong environmental concerns due to their pervasive presence and potential adverse effects. Lagoon ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to PAE pollution as they are semi-enclosed and receive high loads of organic materials. The present study investigates the distribution of seven common PAEs in three large European lagoons (Curonian, Vistula and Szczecin) in the southern Baltic Sea. The concentration levels of PAEs in the water column, encompassing both the dissolved and particulate-bound phases, and in sediments were assessed to elucidate distribution patterns and potential ecological risks within these lagoon ecosystems. The average concentration of total PAEs in the water column ranged from 0.03 to 1.45 μg L-1, whereas sediment concentration varied from 0.008 to 1.06 μg g-1, levels comparable to or lower than those found in other European coastal areas. Distribution patterns of PAEs in sediment showed notable similarity across all three lagoons, whereas variations were observed in the water column. Notably, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP) emerged as the most concerning congeners in studied lagoons, all of which pose a moderate risk to aquatic organisms. This study applied shotgun transcriptomic analysis to field samples, revealing active microbial communities involved in PAEs degradation in the Baltic lagoons for the first time. The degradation of phthalic acid (PA) into intermediate compounds such as protocatechuate was not identified as a rate-limiting step in the studied environment. The degradation activity was primarily localized in the sediment layers, with Gram-negative bacteria playing a major role, while Gram-positive bacteria appeared incapable of degrading PA. These findings provide valuable insights into the distribution and transformation mechanisms of PAEs in estuarine environments.",

    "title": "Global Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Distinct Phases of the Endothelial Response to TNF.",
    "abstract": "The vascular endothelium acts as a dynamic interface between blood and tissue. TNF-α, a major regulator of inflammation, induces endothelial cell (EC) transcriptional changes, the overall response dynamics of which have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we conducted an extended time-course analysis of the human EC response to TNF, from 30 min to 72 h. We identified regulated genes and used weighted gene network correlation analysis to decipher coexpression profiles, uncovering two distinct temporal phases: an acute response (between 1 and 4 h) and a later phase (between 12 and 24 h). Sex-based subset analysis revealed that the response was comparable between female and male cells. Several previously uncharacterized genes were strongly regulated during the acute phase, whereas the majority in the later phase were IFN-stimulated genes. A lack of IFN transcription indicated that this IFN-stimulated gene expression was independent of de novo IFN production. We also observed two groups of genes whose transcription was inhibited by TNF: those that resolved toward baseline levels and those that did not. Our study provides insights into the global dynamics of the EC transcriptional response to TNF, highlighting distinct gene expression patterns during the acute and later phases. Data for all coding and noncoding genes is provided on the Web site (http://www.endothelial-response.org/). These findings may be useful in understanding the role of ECs in inflammation and in developing TNF signaling-targeted therapies.",

    "title": "METTL3 drives telomere targeting of TERRA lncRNA through m6A-dependent R-loop formation: a therapeutic target for ALT-positive neuroblastoma.",
    "abstract": "Telomerase-negative tumors maintain telomere length by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), but the underlying mechanism behind ALT remains poorly understood. A proportion of aggressive neuroblastoma (NB), particularly relapsed tumors, are positive for ALT (ALT+), suggesting that a better dissection of the ALT mechanism could lead to novel therapeutic opportunities. TERRA, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) derived from telomere ends, localizes to telomeres in a R-loop-dependent manner and plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance. Here we present evidence that RNA modification at the N6 position of internal adenosine (m6A) in TERRA by the methyltransferase METTL3 is essential for telomere maintenance in ALT+ cells, and the loss of TERRA m6A/METTL3 results in telomere damage. We observed that m6A modification is abundant in R-loop enriched TERRA, and the m6A-mediated recruitment of hnRNPA2B1 to TERRA is critical for R-loop formation. Our findings suggest that m6A drives telomere targeting of TERRA via R-loops, and this m6A-mediated R-loop formation could be a widespread mechanism employed by other chromatin-interacting lncRNAs. Furthermore, treatment of ALT+ NB cells with a METTL3 inhibitor resulted in compromised telomere targeting of TERRA and accumulation of DNA damage at telomeres, indicating that METTL3 inhibition may represent a therapeutic approach for ALT+ NB.",

    "title": "Temporal dynamics of faster neo-Z evolution in butterflies.",
    "abstract": "The faster-Z/X hypothesis predicts that sex-linked genes should diverge faster than autosomal genes. However, studies across different lineages have shown mixed support for this effect. So far, most analyses have focused on old and well-differentiated sex chromosomes, but less is known about the divergence of more recently acquired neo-sex chromosomes. In Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Z-autosome fusions are frequent, but the evolutionary dynamics of neo-Z chromosomes have not been explored in detail. Here, we analyzed the faster-Z effect in Leptidea sinapis, a butterfly with three Z chromosomes. We show that the neo-Z chromosomes have been acquired stepwise, resulting in strata of differentiation and masculinization. While all Z chromosomes showed evidence of the faster-Z effect, selection for genes on the youngest neo-Z chromosome (Z3) appears to have been hampered by a largely intact, homologous neo-W chromosome. However, the intermediately aged neo-Z chromosome (Z2), which lacks W gametologs, showed fewer evolutionary constraints, resulting in particularly fast evolution. Our results therefore support that neo-sex chromosomes can constitute temporary hot-spots of adaptation and divergence. The underlying dynamics are likely causally linked to shifts in selective constraints, evolution of gene expression, and degeneration of W-linked gametologs which gradually expose Z-linked genes to selection.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq, has recently become an attractive method of choice in the studies of transcriptomes, promising several advantages compared with microarrays. In this study, we sought to assess the contribution of the different analytical steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data generated with the Illumina platform, and to perform a cross-platform comparison based on the results obtained through Affymetrix microarray. As a case study for our work we, used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK 113-7D, grown under two different conditions (batch and chemostat). Here, we asses the influence of genetic variation on the estimation of gene expression level using three different aligners for read-mapping (Gsnap, Stampy and TopHat) on S288c genome, the capabilities of five different statistical methods to detect differential gene expression (baySeq, Cuffdiff, DESeq, edgeR and NOISeq) and we explored the consistency between RNA-seq analysis using reference genome and de novo assembly approach. High reproducibility among biological replicates (correlation≥0.99) and high consistency between the two platforms for analysis of gene expression levels (correlation≥0.91) are reported. The results from differential gene expression identification derived from the different statistical methods, as well as their integrated analysis results based on gene ontology annotation are in good agreement. Overall, our study provides a useful and comprehensive comparison between the two platforms (RNA-seq and microrrays) for gene expression analysis and addresses the contribution of the different steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA (aDNA) obtained from human remains is typically fragmented and present in relatively low amounts. Here we investigate a set of optimal methods for producing aDNA data by comparing silica-based DNA extraction and aDNA library preparation protocols. We also test the efficiency of whole-genome enrichment (WGC) on ancient human samples by modifying a number of parameter combinations. We find that the Dabney extraction protocol performs significantly better than alternatives. We further observed a positive trend with the BEST library protocol indicating lower clonality. Notably, our results suggest that WGC is effective at retrieving endogenous DNA, particularly from poorly-preserved human samples, by increasing human endogenous proportions by 5x. Thus, aDNA studies will be most likely to benefit from our results.",

    "abstract": "The Claustrum/dorsal endopiriform cortex complex (CLA) is an enigmatic brain region with extensive glutamatergic projections to multiple cortical areas. The transcription factor Nurr1 is highly expressed in the CLA, but its role in this region is not understood. By using conditional gene-targeted mice, we show that Nurr1 is a crucial regulator of CLA neuron identity. Although CLA neurons remain intact in the absence of Nurr1, the distinctive gene expression pattern in the CLA is abolished. CLA has been hypothesized to control hallucinations, but little is known of how the CLA responds to hallucinogens. After the deletion of Nurr1 in the CLA, both hallucinogen receptor expression and signaling are lost. Furthermore, functional ultrasound and Neuropixel electrophysiological recordings revealed that the hallucinogenic-receptor agonists' effects on functional connectivity between prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices are altered in Nurr1-ablated mice. Our findings suggest that Nurr1-targeted strategies provide additional avenues for functional studies of the CLA.",

    "abstract": "Global classification of the human proteins with regards to spatial expression patterns across organs and tissues is important for studies of human biology and disease. Here, we used a quantitative transcriptomics analysis (RNA-Seq) to classify the tissue-specific expression of genes across a representative set of all major human organs and tissues and combined this analysis with antibody-based profiling of the same tissues. To present the data, we launch a new version of the Human Protein Atlas that integrates RNA and protein expression data corresponding to ∼80% of the human protein-coding genes with access to the primary data for both the RNA and the protein analysis on an individual gene level. We present a classification of all human protein-coding genes with regards to tissue-specificity and spatial expression pattern. The integrative human expression map can be used as a starting point to explore the molecular constituents of the human body.",

    "abstract": "Urban lakes provide multiple benefits to society while influencing life quality. Moreover, lakes and their microbiomes are sentinels of anthropogenic impact and can be used for natural resource management and planning. Here, we release original metagenomic data from several well-characterized and anthropogenically impacted eutrophic lakes in the vicinity of Stockholm (Sweden). Our goal was to collect representative microbial community samples and use shotgun sequencing to provide a broad view on microbial diversity of productive urban lakes. Our dataset has an emphasis on Lake Mälaren as a major drinking water reservoir under anthropogenic impact. This dataset includes short-read sequence data and metagenome assemblies from each of 17 samples collected from eutrophic lakes near the greater Stockholm area. We used genome-resolved metagenomics and obtained 2378 metagenome assembled genomes that de-replicated into 514 species representative genomes. This dataset adds new datapoints to previously sequenced lakes and it includes the first sequenced set of metagenomes from Lake Mälaren. Our dataset serves as a baseline for future monitoring of drinking water reservoirs and urban lakes.",

    "title": "Effects of environmental translocation and host characteristics on skin microbiomes of sun-basking fish.",
    "abstract": "Variation in the composition of skin-associated microbiomes has been attributed to host species, geographical location and habitat, but the role of intraspecific phenotypic variation among host individuals remains elusive. We explored if and how host environment and different phenotypic traits were associated with microbiome composition. We conducted repeated sampling of dorsal and ventral skin microbiomes of carp individuals (Cyprinus carpio) before and after translocation from laboratory conditions to a semi-natural environment. Both alpha and beta diversity of skin-associated microbiomes increased substantially within and among individuals following translocation, particularly on dorsal body sites. The variation in microbiome composition among hosts was significantly associated with body site, sun-basking, habitat switch and growth, but not temperature gain while basking, sex, personality nor colour morph. We suggest that the overall increase in the alpha and beta diversity estimates among hosts were induced by individuals expressing greater variation in behaviours and thus exposure to potential colonizers in the pond environment compared with the laboratory. Our results exemplify how biological diversity at one level of organization (phenotypic variation among and within fish host individuals) together with the external environment impacts biological diversity at a higher hierarchical level of organization (richness and composition of fish-associated microbial communities).",

    "title": "Investigation of a putative melanoma susceptibility locus at chromosome 3q29.",
    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma, the most fatal form of skin cancer, is currently increasing in incidence in many populations. Approximately 10% of all cases occur in families with an inherited predisposition for melanoma. In Sweden, only a minor portion of such melanoma families carry a mutation in the known melanoma gene CDKN2A, and there is a need to identify additional melanoma susceptibility genes. In a recently performed genome-wide linkage screen, novel loci with suggestive evidence of linkage to melanoma were detected. In this study, we have further analyzed one region on chromosome 3q29. In all, 89 affected and 15 nonaffected family members from 42 melanoma-prone families were genotyped for 34 genetic markers. In a pooled linkage analysis of all 42 families, we detected significant evidence of linkage, with a maximum heterogeneity logarithm of odds (HLOD) score of 3.1 with 83% of the families contributing to the linkage score. The minimum critical region of linkage (defined by a 1LOD score support interval) maps to chromosome 3q29, spans 3.5 Mb of genomic sequence, and harbors 44 identified genes. Sequence variants within this region have previously been associated with cancer susceptibility. This study reports the presence of a putative novel melanoma susceptibility locus in the Swedish population, a finding that needs to be replicated in an independent study on other individuals with familial melanoma. Sequencing of genes in the region may identify novel melanoma-associated mutations.",

    "title": "Chromosome-level genome assembly of the morabine grasshopper Vandiemenella viatica19.",
    "abstract": "Morabine grasshoppers in the Vandiemenella viatica species group, which show karyotype diversity, have been studied for their ecological distribution and speciation in relation to their genetic and chromosomal diversity. They are good models for studying sex chromosome evolution as \"old\" and newly emerged sex chromosomes co-exist within the group. Here we present a reference genome for the viatica19 chromosomal race, that possesses the ancestral karyotype within the group. Using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing, we generated a chromosome-level assembly of 4.09 Gb in span, scaffold N50 of 429 Mb, and complete BUSCO score of 98.1%, containing 10 pseudo-chromosomes. We provide Illumina datasets of males and females, used to identify the X chromosome. The assembly contains 19,034 predicted protein-coding genes, and a total of 75.21% of repetitive DNA sequences. By leveraging HiFi reads, we mapped the genome-wide distribution of methylated bases (5mC and 6 mA). This comprehensive assembly offers a robust reference for morabine grasshoppers and supports further research into speciation and sex chromosome diversification within the group and its related species.",

    "abstract": "Adrenal tumors autonomously producing cortisol cause Cushing's syndrome. We performed exome sequencing of 25 tumor-normal pairs and identified 2 subgroups. Eight tumors (including three carcinomas) had many somatic copy number variants (CNVs) with frequent deletion of CDC42 and CDKN2A, amplification of 5q31.2 and protein-altering mutations in TP53 and RB1. Seventeen tumors (all adenomas) had no somatic CNVs or TP53 or RB1 mutations. Six of these had known gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 (β-catenin) or GNAS (Gαs). Six others had somatic mutations in PRKACA (protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit) resulting in a p.Leu206Arg substitution. Further sequencing identified this mutation in 13 of 63 tumors (35% of adenomas with overt Cushing's syndrome). PRKACA, GNAS and CTNNB1 mutations were mutually exclusive. Leu206 directly interacts with the regulatory subunit of PKA, PRKAR1A. Leu206Arg PRKACA loses PRKAR1A binding, increasing the phosphorylation of downstream targets. PKA activity induces cortisol production and cell proliferation, providing a mechanism for tumor development. These findings define distinct mechanisms underlying adrenal cortisol-producing tumors.",

    "abstract": "Del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System as low- or intermediate-1-risk (lower-risk) are considered to have an indolent course; however, recent data have identified a subgroup of these patients with more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes. Using deep sequencing technology, we previously demonstrated that 18% of patients with lower-risk del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes carry TP53 mutated subclones rendering them at higher risk of progression. In this study, bone marrow biopsies from 85 patients treated with lenalidomide in the MDS-004 clinical trial were retrospectively assessed for p53 expression by immunohistochemistry in association with outcome. Strong p53 expression in ≥ 1% of bone marrow progenitor cells, observed in 35% (30 of 85) of patients, was significantly associated with higher acute myeloid leukemia risk (P=0.0006), shorter overall survival (P=0.0175), and a lower cytogenetic response rate (P=0.009), but not with achievement or duration of 26-week transfusion independence response. In a multivariate analysis, p53-positive immunohistochemistry was the strongest independent predictor of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.0035). Pyrosequencing analysis of laser-microdissected cells with strong p53 expression confirmed the TP53 mutation, whereas cells with moderate expression predominantly had wild-type p53. This study validates p53 immunohistochemistry as a strong and clinically useful predictive tool in patients with lower-risk del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes. This study was based on data from the MDS 004 trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00179621).",

    "title": "An international effort towards developing standards for best practices in analysis, interpretation and reporting of clinical genome sequencing results in the CLARITY Challenge.",
    "abstract": "There is tremendous potential for genome sequencing to improve clinical diagnosis and care once it becomes routinely accessible, but this will require formalizing research methods into clinical best practices in the areas of sequence data generation, analysis, interpretation and reporting. The CLARITY Challenge was designed to spur convergence in methods for diagnosing genetic disease starting from clinical case history and genome sequencing data. DNA samples were obtained from three families with heritable genetic disorders and genomic sequence data were donated by sequencing platform vendors. The challenge was to analyze and interpret these data with the goals of identifying disease-causing variants and reporting the findings in a clinically useful format. Participating contestant groups were solicited broadly, and an independent panel of judges evaluated their performance.\n\nA total of 30 international groups were engaged. The entries reveal a general convergence of practices on most elements of the analysis and interpretation process. However, even given this commonality of approach, only two groups identified the consensus candidate variants in all disease cases, demonstrating a need for consistent fine-tuning of the generally accepted methods. There was greater diversity of the final clinical report content and in the patient consenting process, demonstrating that these areas require additional exploration and standardization.\n\nThe CLARITY Challenge provides a comprehensive assessment of current practices for using genome sequencing to diagnose and report genetic diseases. There is remarkable convergence in bioinformatic techniques, but medical interpretation and reporting are areas that require further development by many groups.",

    "abstract": "The duplication-triplication/inverted-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP) structure is a complex genomic rearrangement (CGR). Although it has been identified as an important pathogenic DNA mutation signature in genomic disorders and cancer genomes, its architecture remains unresolved. Here, we studied the genomic architecture of DUP-TRP/INV-DUP by investigating the DNA of 24 patients identified by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on whom we found evidence for the existence of 4 out of 4 predicted structural variant (SV) haplotypes. Using a combination of short-read genome sequencing (GS), long-read GS, optical genome mapping, and single-cell DNA template strand sequencing (strand-seq), the haplotype structure was resolved in 18 samples. The point of template switching in 4 samples was shown to be a segment of ∼2.2-5.5 kb of 100% nucleotide similarity within inverted repeat pairs. These data provide experimental evidence that inverted low-copy repeats act as recombinant substrates. This type of CGR can result in multiple conformers generating diverse SV haplotypes in susceptible dosage-sensitive loci.",

    "title": "Robust isolation of malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma",
    "abstract": "Molecular characterization of malignant plasma cells is increasingly important for diagnostic and therapeutic stratification in multiple myeloma. However, the malignant plasma cells represent a relatively small subset of bone marrow cells, and need to be enriched prior to analysis. Currently, the cell surface marker CD138 (SDC1) is used for this enrichment, but has an important limitation in that its expression decreases rapidly after sampling. Seeking alternatives to CD138, we performed a computational screen for myeloma plasma cell markers and systematically evaluated 7 candidates. Our results conclusively show that the markers CD319 (SLAMF7/CS1) and CD269 (TNFRSF17/BCMA) are considerably more robust than CD138 and enable isolation of myeloma plasma cells under more diverse conditions, including the samples that have been delayed or frozen. Our results form the basis of improved procedures for characterizing cases of multiple myeloma in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) are 2 distinct types of sarcoma, with a subset of cases showing overlapping morphologic and immunohistochemical features. LGFMS is characterized by expression of the MUC4 protein, and about 90% of cases display a distinctive FUS-CREB3L2 gene fusion. In addition, SEF is often MUC4 positive, but is genetically less well studied. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies have shown involvement of the FUS gene in the majority of so-called hybrid LGFMS/SEF and in 10% to 25% of sarcomas with pure SEF morphology. In this study, we investigated a series of 10 primary tumors showing pure SEF morphology, 4 cases of LGFMS that at local or distant relapse showed predominant SEF morphology, and 1 primary hybrid LGFMS/SEF. All but 1 case showed diffuse expression for MUC4. Using FISH, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and/or mRNA sequencing in selected cases, we found recurrent EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion transcripts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 3/10 pure SEF cases and splits and deletions of the EWSR1 and/or CREB3L1 genes by FISH in 6 additional cases. All 5 cases of LGFMS with progression to SEF morphology or hybrid features had FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts. Our results indicate that EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, highlighting that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types, with different impacts on patient outcome.",

    "title": "Elucidating the interactions between the human gut microbiota and its host through metabolic modeling.",
    "abstract": "Increased understanding of the interactions between the gut microbiota, diet and environmental effects may allow us to design efficient treatment strategies for addressing global health problems. Existence of symbiotic microorganisms in the human gut provides different functions for the host such as conversion of nutrients, training of the immune system, and resistance to pathogens. The gut microbiome also plays an influential role in maintaining human health, and it is a potential target for prevention and treatment of common disorders including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Due to the extreme complexity of such disorders, it is necessary to develop mathematical models for deciphering the role of its individual elements as well as the entire system and such models may assist in better understanding of the interactions between the bacteria in the human gut and the host by use of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). Recently, GEMs have been employed to explore the interactions between predominant bacteria in the gut ecosystems. Additionally, these models enabled analysis of the contribution of each species to the overall metabolism of the microbiota through the integration of omics data. The outcome of these studies can be used for proposing optimal conditions for desired microbiome phenotypes. Here, we review the recent progress and challenges for elucidating the interactions between the human gut microbiota and host through metabolic modeling. We discuss how these models may provide scaffolds for analyzing high-throughput data, developing probiotics and prebiotics, evaluating the effects of probiotics and prebiotics and eventually designing clinical interventions.",

    "title": "Immune system adaptation during gender-affirming testosterone treatment.",
    "abstract": "Infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions present differently in males and females. SARS-CoV-2 infection in naive males is associated with increased risk of death, whereas females are at increased risk of long COVID1, similar to observations in other infections2. Females respond more strongly to vaccines, and adverse reactions are more frequent3, like most autoimmune diseases4. Immunological sex differences stem from genetic, hormonal and behavioural factors5 but their relative importance is only partially understood6-8. In individuals assigned female sex at birth and undergoing gender-affirming testosterone therapy (trans men), hormone concentrations change markedly but the immunological consequences are poorly understood. Here we performed longitudinal systems-level analyses in 23 trans men and found that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumour necrosis factor. This is mediated by functional attenuation of type-I interferon responses in both plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes. Conversely, testosterone potentiates monocyte responses leading to increased tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-15 production and downstream activation of nuclear factor kappa B-regulated genes and potentiation of interferon-γ responses, primarily in natural killer cells. These findings in trans men are corroborated by sex-divergent responses in public datasets and illustrate the dynamic regulation of human immunity by sex hormones, with implications for the health of individuals undergoing hormone therapy and our understanding of sex-divergent immune responses in cisgender individuals.",

    "title": "A Drosophila immune response against Ras-induced overgrowth.",
    "abstract": "Our goal is to characterize the innate immune response against the early stage of tumor development. For this, animal models where genetic changes in specific cells and tissues can be performed in a controlled way have become increasingly important, including the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Many tumor mutants in Drosophila affect the germline and, as a consequence, also the immune system itself, making it difficult to ascribe their phenotype to a specific tissue. Only during the past decade, mutations have been induced systematically in somatic cells to study the control of tumorous growth by neighboring cells and by immune cells. Here we show that upon ectopic expression of a dominant-active form of the Ras oncogene (Ras(V12)), both imaginal discs and salivary glands are affected. Particularly, the glands increase in size, express metalloproteinases and display apoptotic markers. This leads to a strong cellular response, which has many hallmarks of the granuloma-like encapsulation reaction, usually mounted by the insect against larger foreign objects. RNA sequencing of the fat body reveals a characteristic humoral immune response. In addition we also identify genes that are specifically induced upon expression of Ras(V12). As a proof-of-principle, we show that one of the induced genes (santa-maria), which encodes a scavenger receptor, modulates damage to the salivary glands. The list of genes we have identified provides a rich source for further functional characterization. Our hope is that this will lead to a better understanding of the earliest stage of innate immune responses against tumors with implications for mammalian immunity.",

    "title": "Genetic constraints in genes exhibiting splicing plasticity in facultative diapause.",
    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is produced and maintained by processes regulating the transcriptome. While differential gene expression is among the most important of these processes, relatively little is known about other sources of transcriptional variation. Previous work suggests that alternative splicing plays an extensive and functionally unique role in transcriptional plasticity, though plastically spliced genes may be more constrained than the remainder of expressed genes. In this study, we explore the relationship between expression and splicing plasticity, along with the genetic diversity in those genes, in an ecologically consequential polyphenism: facultative diapause. Using 96 samples spread over two tissues and 10 timepoints, we compare the extent of differential splicing and expression between diapausing and direct developing pupae of the butterfly Pieris napi. Splicing differs strongly between diapausing and direct developing trajectories but alters a smaller and functionally unique set of genes compared to differential expression. We further test the hypothesis that among these expressed loci, plastically spliced genes are likely to experience the strongest purifying selection to maintain seasonally plastic phenotypes. Genes with unique transcriptional changes through diapause consistently had the lowest nucleotide diversity, and this effect was consistently stronger among genes that were differentially spliced compared to those with just differential expression through diapause. Further, the strength of negative selection was higher in the population expressing diapause every generation. Our results suggest that maintenance of the molecular mechanisms involved in diapause progression, including post-transcriptional modifications, are highly conserved and likely to experience genetic constraints, especially in northern populations of P. napi.",

    "title": "Whole-genome sequencing in prenatally detected congenital malformations: prospective cohort study in clinical setting.",
    "abstract": "To investigate the diagnostic yield of trio whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in fetuses with various congenital malformations referred to a tertiary center for prenatal diagnosis.\n\nIn this prospective study, 50 pregnancies with different congenital malformations, negative for trisomies and causative copy-number variants, were analyzed further with fetal-parental trio WGS analysis. Parents were eligible for inclusion if they accepted further investigation following the detection of isolated or multiple malformations on prenatal ultrasound. Cases with isolated increased nuchal translucency, gamete donation or multiple pregnancy were excluded. WGS with the Illumina Inc. 30× polymerase-chain-reaction-free short-read sequencing included analysis of single-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, structural variants, short tandem repeats and copy-number identification of SMN1 and SMN2 genes.\n\nA molecular diagnosis was achieved in 13/50 (26%) cases. Causative sequence variants were identified in 12 genes: FGFR3 (n = 2), ACTA1 (n = 1), CDH2 (n = 1), COL1A2 (n = 1), DHCR7 (n = 1), EYA1 (n = 1), FBXO11 (n = 1), FRAS1 (n = 1), L1CAM (n = 1), OFD1 (n = 1), PDHA1 (n = 1) and SOX9 (n = 1). The phenotypes of the cases were divided into different groups, with the following diagnostic yields: skeletal malformation (4/9 (44%)), multisystem malformation (3/7 (43%)), central nervous system malformation (5/15 (33%)) and thoracic malformation (1/10 (10%)). Additionally, two cases carried variants that were considered potentially clinically relevant, even though they were assessed as variants of uncertain significance, according to the guidelines provided by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Overall, we identified a causative or potentially clinically relevant variant in 15/50 (30%) cases.\n\nWe demonstrate a diagnostic yield of 26% with clinical WGS in prenatally detected congenital malformations. This study emphasizes the benefits that WGS can bring to the diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies. It is important to note that causative chromosomal aberrations were excluded from our cohort before WGS. As chromosomal aberrations are a well-known cause of prenatally detected congenital malformations, future studies using WGS as a primary diagnostic test, including assessment of chromosomal aberrations, may show that the detection rate exceeds the diagnostic yield of this study. WGS can add clinically relevant information, explaining the underlying cause of the fetal anomaly, which will provide information concerning the specific prognosis of the condition, as well as estimate the risk of recurrence. A genetic diagnosis can also provide more reproductive choice for future pregnancies. © 2024 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Dictyostelium intermediate repeat sequence 1 (DIRS-1) is the founding member of a poorly characterized class of retrotransposable elements that contain inverse long terminal repeats and tyrosine recombinase instead of DDE-type integrase enzymes. In Dictyostelium discoideum, DIRS-1 forms clusters that adopt the function of centromeres, rendering tight retrotransposition control critical to maintaining chromosome integrity. We report that in deletion strains of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RrpC, full-length and shorter DIRS-1 messenger RNAs are strongly enriched. Shorter versions of a hitherto unknown long non-coding RNA in DIRS-1 antisense orientation are also enriched in rrpC- strains. Concurrent with the accumulation of long transcripts, the vast majority of small (21 mer) DIRS-1 RNAs vanish in rrpC- strains. RNASeq reveals an asymmetric distribution of the DIRS-1 small RNAs, both along DIRS-1 and with respect to sense and antisense orientation. We show that RrpC is required for post-transcriptional DIRS-1 silencing and also for spreading of RNA silencing signals. Finally, DIRS-1 mis-regulation in the absence of RrpC leads to retrotransposon mobilization. In summary, our data reveal RrpC as a key player in the silencing of centromeric retrotransposon DIRS-1. RrpC acts at the post-transcriptional level and is involved in spreading of RNA silencing signals, both in the 5' and 3' directions.",

Here we present the metagenomic analysis of three pieces of chewed pitch from Huseby Klev, Sweden, that were dated to 9,890-9,540 before present. The metagenomic profile exposes a Mesolithic oral microbiome that includes opportunistic oral pathogens. We compared the data with healthy and dysbiotic microbiome datasets and we identified increased abundance of periodontitis-associated microbes. In addition, trained machine learning models predicted dysbiosis with 70-80% probability. Moreover, we identified DNA sequences from eukaryotic species such as red fox, hazelnut, red deer and apple. Our results indicate a case of poor oral health during the Scandinavian Mesolithic, and show that pitch pieces have the potential to provide information on material use, diet and oral health.",

    "title": "Divergent gene expression responses in two Baltic Sea heterotrophic model bacteria to dinoflagellate dissolved organic matter.",
    "abstract": "Phytoplankton release massive amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the water column during recurring blooms in coastal waters and inland seas. The released DOM encompasses a complex mixture of both known and unknown compounds, and is a rich nutrient source for heterotrophic bacteria. The metabolic activity of bacteria during and after phytoplankton blooms can hence be expected to reflect the characteristics of the released DOM. We therefore investigated if bacterioplankton could be used as \"living sensors\" of phytoplankton DOM quantity and/or quality, by applying gene expression analyses to identify bacterial metabolisms induced by DOM. We used transcriptional analysis of two Baltic Sea bacterial isolates (Polaribacter sp. BAL334 [Flavobacteriia] and Brevundimonas sp. BAL450 [Alphaproteobacteria]) growing with DOM from axenic cultures of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum. We observed pronounced differences between the two bacteria both in growth and the expressed metabolic pathways in cultures exposed to dinoflagellate DOM compared with controls. Differences in metabolic responses between the two isolates were caused both by differences in gene repertoire between them (e.g. in the SEED categories for membrane transport, motility and photoheterotrophy) and the regulation of expression (e.g. fatty acid metabolism), emphasizing the importance of separating the responses of different taxa in analyses of community sequence data. Similarities between the bacteria included substantially increased expression of genes for Ton and Tol transport systems in both isolates, which are commonly associated with uptake of complex organic molecules. Polaribacter sp. BAL334 showed stronger metabolic responses to DOM harvested from exponential than stationary phase dinoflagellates (128 compared to 26 differentially expressed genes), whereas Brevundimonas sp. BAL450 responded more to the DOM from stationary than exponential phase dinoflagellates (33 compared to 6 differentially expressed genes). These findings suggest that shifts in bacterial metabolisms during different phases of phytoplankton blooms can be detected in individual bacterial species and can provide insights into their involvement in DOM transformations.",

    "title": "SpliceVista, a tool for splice variant identification and visualization in shotgun proteomics data.",
    "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a pervasive process in eukaryotic organisms. More than 90% of human genes have alternatively spliced products, and aberrant splicing has been shown to be associated with many diseases. Current methods employed in the detection of splice variants include prediction by clustering of expressed sequence tags, exon microarray, and mRNA sequencing, all methods focusing on RNA-level information. There is a lack of tools for analyzing splice variants at the protein level. Here, we present SpliceVista, a tool for splice variant identification and visualization based on mass spectrometry proteomics data. SpliceVista retrieves gene structure and translated sequences from alternative splicing databases and maps MS-identified peptides to splice variants. The visualization module plots the exon composition of each splice variant and aligns identified peptides with transcript positions. If quantitative mass spectrometry data are used, SpliceVista plots the quantitative patterns for each peptide and provides users with the option to cluster peptides based on their quantitative patterns. SpliceVista can identify splice-variant-specific peptides, providing the possibility for variant-specific analysis. The tool was tested on two experimental datasets (PXD000065 and PXD000134). In A431 cells treated with gefitinib, 2983 splice-variant-specific peptides corresponding to 939 splice variants were identified. Through comparison of splice-variant-centric, protein-centric, and gene-centric quantification, several genes (e.g. EIF4H) were found to have differentially regulated splice variants after gefitinib treatment. The same discrepancy between protein-centric and splice-centric quantification was detected in the other dataset, in which induced pluripotent stem cells were compared with parental fibroblast and human embryotic stem cells. In addition, SpliceVista can be used to visualize novel splice variants inferred from peptide-level evidence. In summary, SpliceVista enables visualization, detection, and differential quantification of protein splice variants that are often missed in current proteomics pipelines.",

    "abstract": "The distribution and community assembly of above- and belowground microbial communities associated with individual plants remain poorly understood, despite its consequences for plant-microbe interactions and plant health. Depending on how microbial communities are structured, we can expect different effects of the microbial community on the health of individual plants and on ecosystem processes. Importantly, the relative role of different factors will likely differ with the scale examined. Here, we address the driving factors at a landscape level, where each individual unit (oak trees) is accessible to a joint species pool. This allowed to quantify the relative effect of environmental factors and dispersal on the distribution of two types of fungal communities: those associated with the leaves and those associated with the soil of Quercus robur trees in a landscape in southwestern Finland. Within each community type, we compared the role of microclimatic, phenological, and spatial variables, and across community types, we examined the degree of association between the respective communities. Most of the variation in the foliar fungal community was found within trees, whereas soil fungal community composition showed positive spatial autocorrelation up to 50 m. Microclimate, tree phenology, and tree spatial connectivity explained little variation in the foliar and soil fungal communities. Foliar and soil fungal communities differed strongly in community structure, with no significant concordance detected between them. We provide evidence that foliar and soil fungal communities assemble independent of each other and are structured by different ecological processes.",

    "title": "Sequencing degraded RNA addressed by 3' tag counting.",
    "abstract": "RNA sequencing has become widely used in gene expression profiling experiments. Prior to any RNA sequencing experiment the quality of the RNA must be measured to assess whether or not it can be used for further downstream analysis. The RNA integrity number (RIN) is a scale used to measure the quality of RNA that runs from 1 (completely degraded) to 10 (intact). Ideally, samples with high RIN (> 8) are used in RNA sequencing experiments. RNA, however, is a fragile molecule which is susceptible to degradation and obtaining high quality RNA is often hard, or even impossible when extracting RNA from certain clinical tissues. Thus, occasionally, working with low quality RNA is the only option the researcher has. Here we investigate the effects of RIN on RNA sequencing and suggest a computational method to handle data from samples with low quality RNA which also enables reanalysis of published datasets. Using RNA from a human cell line we generated and sequenced samples with varying RINs and illustrate what effect the RIN has on the basic procedure of RNA sequencing; both quality aspects and differential expression. We show that the RIN has systematic effects on gene coverage, false positives in differential expression and the quantification of duplicate reads. We introduce 3' tag counting (3TC) as a computational approach to reliably estimate differential expression for samples with low RIN. We show that using the 3TC method in differential expression analysis significantly reduces false positives when comparing samples with different RIN, while retaining reasonable sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "B cell function and autoantibodies are important in SLE pathogenesis. In this work, we aimed to investigate the impact of cumulative SLE B cell genetics on SLE subphenotype and autoantibody profile.\n\nFemale patients with SLE (n=1248) and healthy controls (n=400) were genotyped using Illumina's Global Screening Array. Two polygenic risk scores (PRSs), one representing B cell genes and the other B cell activation genes, were calculated for each individual using risk loci for SLE in genes assigned to B cell-related pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology and Reactome Databases.\n\nDouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies were more prevalent among patients with a high compared with a low SLE B cell PRS (OR 1.47 (1.07 to 2.01), p=0.018), and effect sizes were augmented in patients with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) risk haplotypes HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 (DRB1*03/15 -/- (OR 0.99 (0.56 to 1.77), p=0.98; DRB1*03/15 +/- or -/+ (OR 1.64 (1.06 to 2.54), p=0.028; and DRB1*03/15 +/+ (OR 4.47 (1.21 to 16.47), p=0.024). Further, a high compared with a low B cell PRS was associated with low complement levels in DRB1*03/15 +/+ patients (OR 3.92 (1.22 to 12.64), p=0.022). The prevalence of lupus nephritis (LN) was higher in patients with a B cell activation PRS above the third quartile compared with patients below (OR 1.32 (1.00 to 1.74), p=0.048).\n\nHigh genetic burden related to B cell function is associated with dsDNA antibody development and LN. Assessing B cell PRSs may be important in order to determine immunological pathways influencing SLE and to predict clinical phenotype.",

    "title": "High risk of tobacco-related cancers in CDKN2A mutation-positive melanoma families.",
    "abstract": "Germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDKN2A occur in 5-20% of familial melanoma cases. A single founder mutation, p.Arg112dup, accounts for the majority of CDKN2A mutations in Swedish carriers. In a national program, carriers of p.Arg112dup mutation have been identified. The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in p.Arg112dup carriers and their first degree relatives (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRs).\n\nIn this prospective cohort study, cancer diagnoses in carriers (n=120), non-carriers (n=111), carriers' FDRs (n=275) and SDRs (n=321) and controls (n=3976) were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Relative risks (RRs) for cancers were calculated (number of cancers/person years). Two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for all RRs.\n\nIn carriers prospective RR for non-melanoma cancers was 5.0 (95% CI 3.7 to 7.3), for pancreatic cancer 43.8 (95% CI 13.8 to 139.0), for cancers in upper digestive tissues 17.1 (95% CI 6.3 to 46.5), and in respiratory tissues 15.6 (5.4 to 46.0). In FDRs and SDRs RRs were significantly elevated for cancers in pancreas, respiratory and upper digestive tissues. In ever-smoking carriers compared with never-smoking carriers, the odds ratio (OR) of cancers in pancreas, respiratory or upper digestive tissues was 9.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 44.7).\n\nCDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers from melanoma-prone families and their FDRs and SDRs have elevated risk for pancreatic, lung, head and neck and gastro-oesophageal carcinomas. These cancers were mainly seen in ever-smoking carriers. Germline CDKN2A mutations may confer an increased sensitivity to carcinogens in tobacco smoke. CDKN2A mutation carriers should be counselled to abstain from smoking.",

    "abstract": "The abundance and composition of genes involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds provide important information on the biodegradation potential of organic pollutants and naturally occurring compounds in the environment. We studied catechol 2, 3 dioxygenase (C23O) and benzylsuccinate synthase (bssA) genes coding for key enzymes of aerobic and anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds in experimental incubations with sediments from two contrasting lakes; humic lake Svarttjärn and eutrophic Vallentunasjön, respectively. Sediment cores from both lakes were incubated continuously for 5 months at constant temperatures ranging from 1.0 to 21.0 °C. The difference in C23O gene composition of the sediment analyzed at the end of the experiment was larger between lakes, than among temperature treatments within each lake. The abundance of C23O gene copies and measured respiration was positively correlated with temperature in Vallentunasjön, whereas putative C23O genes were present in lower concentrations in Svarttjärn sediments. Putative bssA genes were only detected in Svarttjärn. For both lakes, the two catabolic genes were most abundant in the surface sediment. The results emphasize the important role of temperature and nutrient availability in controlling the functional potential of sediment microorganisms and reveal differences between systems with contrasting trophic status. A better understanding of catabolic pathways and enzymes will enable more accurate forecasting of the functional properties of ecosystems under various scenarios of environmental change.",

    "abstract": "EZH2 is overexpressed in poor-prognostic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cases, acting as an oncogene; however, thus far, the EZH2 target genes in CLL have not been disclosed. In this study, using ChIP-sequencing, we identified EZH2 and H3K27me3 target genes in two prognostic subgroups of CLL with distinct prognosis and outcome, i.e., cases with unmutated (U-CLL, n = 6) or mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL, n = 6). While the majority of oncogenic pathways were equally enriched for EZH2 target genes in both prognostic subgroups, PI3K pathway genes were differentially bound by EZH2 in U-CLL versus M-CLL. The occupancy of EZH2 for selected PI3K pathway target genes was validated in additional CLL samples (n = 16) and CLL cell lines using siRNA-mediated EZH2 downregulation and ChIP assays. Intriguingly, we found that EZH2 directly binds to the IGF1R promoter along with MYC and upregulates IGF1R expression in U-CLL, leading to downstream PI3K activation. By investigating an independent CLL cohort (n = 96), a positive correlation was observed between EZH2 and IGF1R expression with higher levels in U-CLL compared to M-CLL. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated downregulation of either EZH2, MYC or IGF1R and treatment with EZH2 and MYC pharmacological inhibitors in the HG3 CLL cell line induced a significant reduction in PI3K pathway activation. In conclusion, we characterize for the first time EZH2 target genes in CLL revealing a hitherto unknown implication of EZH2 in modulating the PI3K pathway in a non-canonical, PRC2-independent way, with potential therapeutic implications considering that PI3K inhibitors are effective therapeutic agents for CLL.",

    "title": "Dual RNA Sequencing Reveals Key Events When Different Giardia Life Cycle Stages Interact With Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells In Vitro.",
    "abstract": "Giardia intestinalis is a protozoan parasite causing diarrheal disease, giardiasis, after extracellular infection of humans and other mammals' intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of the upper small intestine. The parasite has two main life cycle stages: replicative trophozoites and transmissive cysts. Differentiating parasites (encysting cells) and trophozoites have recently been shown to be present in the same regions of the upper small intestine, whereas most mature cysts are found further down in the intestinal system. To learn more about host-parasite interactions during Giardia infections, we used an in vitro model of the parasite's interaction with host IECs (differentiated Caco-2 cells) and Giardia WB trophozoites, early encysting cells (7 h), and cysts. Dual RNA sequencing (Dual RNAseq) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in both Giardia and the IECs, which might relate to establishing infection and disease induction. In the human cells, the largest gene expression changes were found in immune and MAPK signaling, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cholesterol metabolism and oxidative stress. The different life cycle stages of Giardia induced a core of similar DEGs but at different levels and there are many life cycle stage-specific DEGs. The metabolic protein PCK1, the transcription factors HES7, HEY1 and JUN, the peptide hormone CCK and the mucins MUC2 and MUC5A are up-regulated in the IECs by trophozoites but not cysts. Cysts specifically induce the chemokines CCL4L2, CCL5 and CXCL5, the signaling protein TRKA and the anti-bacterial protein WFDC12. The parasite, in turn, up-regulated a large number of hypothetical genes, high cysteine membrane proteins (HCMPs) and oxidative stress response genes. Early encysting cells have unique DEGs compared to trophozoites (e.g. several uniquely up-regulated HCMPs) and interaction of these cells with IECs affected the encystation process. Our data show that different life cycle stages of Giardia induce different gene expression responses in the host cells and that the IECs in turn differentially affect the gene expression in trophozoites and early encysting cells. This life cycle stage-specific host-parasite cross-talk is an important aspect to consider during further studies of Giardia's molecular pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The limited tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to inhibitors is a major challenge in second-generation bioethanol production, and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms providing tolerance to inhibitor-rich lignocellulosic hydrolysates is incomplete. Short-term adaptation of the yeast in the presence of dilute hydrolysate can improve its robustness and productivity during subsequent fermentation.\n\nWe utilized RNA sequencing to investigate differential gene expression in the industrial yeast strain CR01 during short-term adaptation, mimicking industrial conditions for cell propagation. In this first transcriptomic study of short-term adaption of S. cerevisiae to lignocellulosic hydrolysate, we found that cultures respond by fine-tuned up- and down-regulation of a subset of general stress response genes. Furthermore, time-resolved RNA sequencing allowed for identification of genes that were differentially expressed at 2 or more sampling points, revealing the importance of oxidative stress response, thiamin and biotin biosynthesis. furan-aldehyde reductases and specific drug:H+ antiporters, as well as the down-regulation of certain transporter genes.\n\nThese findings provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing short-term adaptation of S. cerevisiae to lignocellulosic hydrolysate, and suggest new genetic targets for improving fermentation robustness.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule techniques are ideally poised to characterize complex dynamics but are typically limited to investigating a small number of different samples. However, a large sequence or chemical space often needs to be explored to derive a comprehensive understanding of complex biological processes. Here we describe multiplexed single-molecule characterization at the library scale (MUSCLE), a method that combines single-molecule fluorescence microscopy with next-generation sequencing to enable highly multiplexed observations of complex dynamics. We comprehensively profiled the sequence dependence of DNA hairpin properties and Cas9-induced target DNA unwinding-rewinding dynamics. The ability to explore a large sequence space for Cas9 allowed us to identify a number of target sequences with unexpected behaviors. We envision that MUSCLE will enable the mechanistic exploration of many fundamental biological processes.",

    "title": "Functional tradeoffs underpin salinity-driven divergence in microbial community composition.",
    "abstract": "Bacterial community composition and functional potential change subtly across gradients in the surface ocean. In contrast, while there are significant phylogenetic divergences between communities from freshwater and marine habitats, the underlying mechanisms to this phylogenetic structuring yet remain unknown. We hypothesized that the functional potential of natural bacterial communities is linked to this striking divide between microbiomes. To test this hypothesis, metagenomic sequencing of microbial communities along a 1,800 km transect in the Baltic Sea area, encompassing a continuous natural salinity gradient from limnic to fully marine conditions, was explored. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that salinity is the main determinant of dramatic changes in microbial community composition, but also of large scale changes in core metabolic functions of bacteria. Strikingly, genetically and metabolically different pathways for key metabolic processes, such as respiration, biosynthesis of quinones and isoprenoids, glycolysis and osmolyte transport, were differentially abundant at high and low salinities. These shifts in functional capacities were observed at multiple taxonomic levels and within dominant bacterial phyla, while bacteria, such as SAR11, were able to adapt to the entire salinity gradient. We propose that the large differences in central metabolism required at high and low salinities dictate the striking divide between freshwater and marine microbiomes, and that the ability to inhabit different salinity regimes evolved early during bacterial phylogenetic differentiation. These findings significantly advance our understanding of microbial distributions and stress the need to incorporate salinity in future climate change models that predict increased levels of precipitation and a reduction in salinity.",

The genetic correlation (rg) between COA and AOA was 0.67. Variation in age of onset among COA-affected individuals had a low heritability (h2g = 5%), which we confirmed in independent studies and also among AOA-affected individuals. To identify subtype-specific genetic associations, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the UK Biobank for COA (13,962 affected individuals) and a separate GWAS for AOA (26,582 affected individuals) by using a common set of 300,671 controls for both studies. We identified 123 independent associations for COA and 56 for AOA (37 overlapped); of these, 98 and 34, respectively, were reproducible in an independent study (n = 262,767). Collectively, 28 associations were not previously reported. For 96 COA-associated variants, including five variants that represent COA-specific risk factors, the risk allele was more common in COA- than in AOA-affected individuals. Conversely, we identified three variants that are stronger risk factors for AOA. Variants associated with obesity and smoking had a stronger contribution to the risk of AOA than to the risk of COA. Lastly, we identified 109 likely target genes of the associated variants, primarily on the basis of correlated expression quantitative trait loci (up to n = 31,684). GWAS informed by age of onset can identify subtype-specific risk variants, which can help us understand differences in pathophysiology between COA and AOA and so can be informative for drug development.",

    "title": "Male-biased migration from East Africa introduced pastoralism into southern Africa.",
    "abstract": "Hunter-gatherer lifestyles dominated the southern African landscape up to ~ 2000 years ago, when herding and farming groups started to arrive in the area. First, herding and livestock, likely of East African origin, appeared in southern Africa, preceding the arrival of the large-scale Bantu-speaking agro-pastoralist expansion that introduced West African-related genetic ancestry into the area. Present-day Khoekhoe-speaking Namaqua (or Nama in short) pastoralists show high proportions of East African admixture, linking the East African ancestry with Khoekhoe herders. Most other historical Khoekhoe populations have, however, disappeared over the last few centuries and their contribution to the genetic structure of present-day populations is not well understood. In our study, we analyzed genome-wide autosomal and full mitochondrial data from a population who trace their ancestry to the Khoekhoe-speaking Hessequa herders from the southern Cape region of what is now South Africa.\n\nWe generated genome-wide data from 162 individuals and mitochondrial DNA data of a subset of 87 individuals, sampled in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, where the Hessequa population once lived. Using available comparative data from Khoe-speaking and related groups, we aligned genetic date estimates and admixture proportions to the archaeological proposed dates and routes for the arrival of the East African pastoralists in southern Africa. We identified several Afro-Asiatic-speaking pastoralist groups from Ethiopia and Tanzania who share high affinities with the East African ancestry present in southern Africa. We also found that the East African pastoralist expansion was heavily male-biased, akin to a pastoralist migration previously observed on the genetic level in ancient Europe, by which Pontic-Caspian Steppe pastoralist groups represented by the Yamnaya culture spread across the Eurasian continent during the late Neolithic/Bronze Age.\n\nWe propose that pastoralism in southern Africa arrived through male-biased migration of an East African Afro-Asiatic-related group(s) who introduced new subsistence and livestock practices to local southern African hunter-gatherers. Our results add to the understanding of historical human migration and mobility in Africa, connected to the spread of food-producing and livestock practices.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is associated with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases in men, and genetic predisposition to LOY is associated with poor poststroke outcome. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that LOY itself is associated with functional outcome after ischemic stroke.\n\nThe study comprised male patients with ischemic stroke from the cohort studies SAHLSIS2 (Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke Phase 2; n=588) and LSR (Lund Stroke Register; n=735). We used binary logistic regression to analyze associations between LOY, determined by DNA microarray intensity data, and poor 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, >2) in each cohort separately and combined. Patients who received recanalization therapy were excluded from sensitivity analyses.\n\nLOY was associated with about 2.5-fold increased risk of poor outcome in univariable analyses (P<0.001). This association withstood separate adjustment for stroke severity and diabetes in both cohorts but not age. In sensitivity analyses restricted to the nonrecanalization group (n=987 in the combined cohort), the association was significant also after separate adjustment for age (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.4]) and when additionally adjusting for stroke severity and diabetes (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.5]).\n\nWe observed an association between LOY and poor outcome after ischemic stroke in patients not receiving recanalization therapy. Future studies on LOY and other somatic genetic alterations in larger stroke cohorts are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Evidence for distinct human cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains contentious and the degree to which different cancer cells contribute to propagating malignancies in patients remains unexplored. In low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we establish the existence of rare multipotent MDS stem cells (MDS-SCs), and their hierarchical relationship to lineage-restricted MDS progenitors. All identified somatically acquired genetic lesions were backtracked to distinct MDS-SCs, establishing their distinct MDS-propagating function in vivo. In isolated del(5q)-MDS, acquisition of del(5q) preceded diverse recurrent driver mutations. Sequential analysis in del(5q)-MDS revealed genetic evolution in MDS-SCs and MDS-progenitors prior to leukemic transformation. These findings provide definitive evidence for rare human MDS-SCs in vivo, with extensive implications for the targeting of the cells required and sufficient for MDS-propagation.",
