    "title": "The Demographic Development of the First Farmers in Anatolia.",
    "abstract": "The archaeological documentation of the development of sedentary farming societies in Anatolia is not yet mirrored by a genetic understanding of the human populations involved, in contrast to the spread of farming in Europe [1-3]. Sedentary farming communities emerged in parts of the Fertile Crescent during the tenth millennium and early ninth millennium calibrated (cal) BC and had appeared in central Anatolia by 8300 cal BC [4]. Farming spread into west Anatolia by the early seventh millennium cal BC and quasi-synchronously into Europe, although the timing and process of this movement remain unclear. Using genome sequence data that we generated from nine central Anatolian Neolithic individuals, we studied the transition period from early Aceramic (Pre-Pottery) to the later Pottery Neolithic, when farming expanded west of the Fertile Crescent. We find that genetic diversity in the earliest farmers was conspicuously low, on a par with European foraging groups. With the advent of the Pottery Neolithic, genetic variation within societies reached levels later found in early European farmers. Our results confirm that the earliest Neolithic central Anatolians belonged to the same gene pool as the first Neolithic migrants spreading into Europe. Further, genetic affinities between later Anatolian farmers and fourth to third millennium BC Chalcolithic south Europeans suggest an additional wave of Anatolian migrants, after the initial Neolithic spread but before the Yamnaya-related migrations. We propose that the earliest farming societies demographically resembled foragers and that only after regional gene flow and rising heterogeneity did the farming population expansions into Europe occur.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to monitor parasite and host gene expression during the early stages of Eimeria tenella infection of chicken cells using dual RNA-Seq analysis. For this, we used chicken macrophage-like cell line HD11 cultures infected in vitro with purified E. tenella sporozoites. Cultures were harvested between 2 and 72 h post-infection and mRNA was extracted and sequenced. Dual RNA-Seq analysis showed clear patterns of altered expression for both parasite and host genes during infection. For example, genes in the chicken immune system showed upregulation early (2–4 h), a strong downregulation of genes across the immune system at 24 h and a repetition of early patterns at 72 h, indicating that invasion by a second generation of parasites was occurring. The observed downregulation may be due to immune self-regulation or to immune evasive mechanisms exerted by E. tenella. Results also suggested pathogen recognition receptors involved in E. tenella innate recognition, MRC2, TLR15 and NLRC5 and showed distinct chemokine and cytokine induction patterns. Moreover, the expression of several functional categories of Eimeria genes, such as rhoptry kinase genes and microneme genes, were also examined, showing distinctive differences which were expressed in sporozoites and merozoites.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of cellular heterogeneity and architecture to white adipose tissue (WAT) function is poorly understood. Herein, we combined spatially resolved transcriptional profiling with single-cell RNA sequencing and image analyses to map human WAT composition and structure. This identified 18 cell classes with unique propensities to form spatially organized homo- and heterotypic clusters. Of these, three constituted mature adipocytes that were similar in size, but distinct in their spatial arrangements and transcriptional profiles. Based on marker genes, we termed these AdipoLEP, AdipoPLIN, and AdipoSAA. We confirmed, in independent datasets, that their respective gene profiles associated differently with both adipocyte and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Corroborating our observations, insulin stimulation in vivo by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp showed that only AdipoPLIN displayed a transcriptional response to insulin. Altogether, by mining this multimodal resource we identify that human WAT is composed of three classes of mature adipocytes, only one of which is insulin responsive.",

    "title": "Prominent epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during and after pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis and controls.",
    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease in which pregnancy leads to a temporary amelioration in disease activity as indicated by the profound decrease in relapses rate during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are implicated in MS pathogenesis as being key regulators of inflammation and brain lesion formation. Although Tcells are prime candidates for the pregnancy-associated improvement of MS, the precise mechanisms are yet unclear, and in particular, a deep characterization of the epigenetic and transcriptomic events that occur in peripheral T cells during pregnancy in MS is lacking.\r\n\r\nWomen with MS and healthy controls were longitudinally sampled before, during (1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters) and after pregnancy. DNA methylation array and RNA sequencing were performed on paired CD4+ and CD8+ T cells samples. Differential analysis and network-based approaches were used to analyze the global dynamics of epigenetic and transcriptomic changes.\r\n\r\nBoth DNA methylation and RNA sequencing revealed a prominent regulation, mostly peaking in the 3rd trimester and reversing post-partum, thus mirroring the clinical course with improvement followed by a worsening in disease activity. This rebound pattern was found to represent a general adaptation of the maternal immune system, with only minor differences between MS and controls. By using a network-based approach, we highlighted several genes at the core of this pregnancy-induced regulation, which were found to be enriched for genes and pathways previously reported to be involved in MS. Moreover, these pathways were enriched for in vitro stimulated genes and pregnancy hormones targets.\r\n\r\nThis study represents, to our knowledge, the first in-depth investigation of the methylation and expression changes in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during pregnancy in MS. Our findings indicate that pregnancy induces profound changes in peripheral T cells, in both MS and healthy controls, which are associated with the modulation of inflammation and MS activity.",

    "title": "Comparison of high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods for ex vivo drug screening.",
    "abstract": "Functional precision medicine (FPM) aims to optimize patient-specific drug selection based on the unique characteristics of their cancer cells. Recent advancements in high throughput ex vivo drug profiling have accelerated interest in FPM. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study for an integrated experimental system that incorporates ex vivo treatment response with a single-cell gene expression output enabling barcoding of several drug conditions in one single-cell sequencing experiment. We demonstrate this through a proof-of-concept investigation focusing on the glucocorticoid-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) E/R+ Reh cell line. Three different single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches were evaluated, each exhibiting high cell recovery and accurate tagging of distinct drug conditions. Notably, our comprehensive analysis revealed variations in library complexity, sensitivity (gene detection), and differential gene expression detection across the methods. Despite these differences, we identified a substantial transcriptional response to fludarabine, a highly relevant drug for treating high-risk ALL, which was consistently recapitulated by all three methods. These findings highlight the potential of our integrated approach for studying drug responses at the single-cell level and emphasize the importance of method selection in scRNA-seq studies. Finally, our data encompassing 27 327 cells are freely available to extend to future scRNA-seq methodological comparisons.",

Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined with tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry, to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.",

    "abstract": "Although the locations of promoters and enhancers have been identified in several cell types, we still have limited information on their connectivity. We developed HiCap, which combines a 4-cutter restriction enzyme Hi-C with sequence capture of promoter regions. Applying the method to mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified promoter-anchored interactions involving 15,905 promoters and 71,984 distal regions. The distal regions were enriched for enhancer marks and transcription, and had a mean fragment size of only 699 bp--close to single-enhancer resolution. High-resolution maps of promoter-anchored interactions with HiCap will be important for detailed characterizations of chromatin interaction landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is common and severe in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). The aim of this study was to identify genetic determinants of fatigue in pSS through a genome-wide association study.\n\nPatients with pSS from Norway, Sweden, UK and USA with fatigue and genotype data available were included. After genotype imputation and quality control, 682 patients and 4 966 157 genetic markers were available. Association analysis in each cohort using linear regression with fatigue as a continuous variable and meta-analyses between the cohorts were performed.\n\nMeta-analysis of the Norwegian and Swedish cohorts identified five polymorphisms within the same linkage disequilibrium block at the receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4)/MASP1 locus associated with fatigue with genome-wide significance (GWS) (p<5×10-8). Patients homozygous for the major allele scored 25 mm higher on the fatigue Visual Analogue Scale than patients homozygous for the minor allele. There were no variants associated with fatigue with GWS in meta-analyses of the US/UK cohorts, or all four cohorts. RTP4 expression in pSS B cells was upregulated and positively correlated with the type I interferon score. Expression quantitative trait loci effects in whole blood for fatigue-associated variants at RTP4/MASP1 and levels of RTP4 and MASP1 expression were identified.\n\nGenetic variations at RTP4/MASP1 are associated with fatigue in Scandinavian pSS patients. RTP4 encodes a Golgi chaperone that influences opioid pain receptor function and MASP1 is involved in complement activation. These results add evidence for genetic influence over fatigue in pSS.",

    "title": "Low-grade glioma risk SNP rs11706832 is associated with type I interferon response pathway genes in cell lines.",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed to our understanding of glioma susceptibility. To date, 25 risk loci for development of any of the glioma subtypes are known. However, GWAS studies reveal little about the molecular processes that lead to increased risk, especially for non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). A particular SNP in intron 2 of LRIG1, rs11706832, has been shown to increase the susceptibility for IDH1 mutated low-grade gliomas (LGG). Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (LRIG1) is important in cancer development as it negatively regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); however, the mechanism responsible for this particular risk SNP and its potential effect on LRIG1 are not known. Using CRISPR-CAS9, we edited rs11706832 in HEK293T cells. Four HEK293T clones with the risk allele were compared to four clones with the non-risk allele for LRIG1 and SLC25A26 gene expression using RT-qPCR, for global gene expression using RNA-seq, and for metabolites using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The experiment did not reveal any significant effect of the SNP on the expression levels or splicing patterns of LRIG1 or SLC25A26. The global gene expression analysis revealed that the risk allele C was associated with upregulation of several mitochondrial genes. Gene enrichment analysis of 74 differentially expressed genes in the genome revealed a significant enrichment of type I interferon response genes, where many genes were downregulated for the risk allele C. Gene expression data of IDH1 mutated LGGs from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) revealed a similar under expression of type I interferon genes associated with the risk allele. This study found the expression levels and splicing patterns of LRIG1 and SLC25A26 were not affected by the SNP in HEK293T cells. However, the risk allele was associated with a downregulation of genes involved in the innate immune response both in the HEK293T cells and in the LGG data from TCGA.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker identification is of utmost importance for the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. Here we make use of a translational database selection strategy, utilizing data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) on differentially expressed protein patterns in healthy and breast cancer tissues as a means to filter out potential biomarkers for underlying genetic causatives of the disease. DNA was isolated from ten breast cancer biopsies, and the protein coding and flanking non-coding genomic regions corresponding to the selected proteins were extracted in a multiplexed format from the samples using a single DNA sequence capture array. Deep sequencing revealed an even enrichment of the multiplexed samples and a great variation of genetic alterations in the tumors of the sampled individuals. Benefiting from the upstream filtering method, the final set of biomarker candidates could be completely verified through bidirectional Sanger sequencing, revealing a 40 percent false positive rate despite high read coverage. Of the variants encountered in translated regions, nine novel non-synonymous variations were identified and verified, two of which were present in more than one of the ten tumor samples.",

    "title": "Evolutionary engineering reveals divergent paths when yeast is adapted to different acidic environments.",
    "abstract": "Tolerance of yeast to acid stress is important for many industrial processes including organic acid production. Therefore, elucidating the molecular basis of long term adaptation to acidic environments will be beneficial for engineering production strains to thrive under such harsh conditions. Previous studies using gene expression analysis have suggested that both organic and inorganic acids display similar responses during short term exposure to acidic conditions. However, biological mechanisms that will lead to long term adaptation of yeast to acidic conditions remains unknown and whether these mechanisms will be similar for tolerance to both organic and inorganic acids is yet to be explored. We therefore evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae to acquire tolerance to HCl (inorganic acid) and to 0.3M L-lactic acid (organic acid) at pH 2.8 and then isolated several low pH tolerant strains. Whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq analysis of the evolved strains revealed different sets of genome alterations suggesting a divergence in adaptation to these two acids. An altered sterol composition and impaired iron uptake contributed to HCl tolerance whereas the formation of a multicellular morphology and rapid lactate degradation was crucial for tolerance to high concentrations of lactic acid. Our findings highlight the contribution of both the selection pressure and nature of the acid as a driver for directing the evolutionary path towards tolerance to low pH. The choice of carbon source was also an important factor in the evolutionary process since cells evolved on two different carbon sources (raffinose and glucose) generated a different set of mutations in response to the presence of lactic acid. Therefore, different strategies are required for a rational design of low pH tolerant strains depending on the acid of interest.",

    "title": "Male-biased migration from East Africa introduced pastoralism into southern Africa.",
    "abstract": "Hunter-gatherer lifestyles dominated the southern African landscape up to ~ 2000 years ago, when herding and farming groups started to arrive in the area. First, herding and livestock, likely of East African origin, appeared in southern Africa, preceding the arrival of the large-scale Bantu-speaking agro-pastoralist expansion that introduced West African-related genetic ancestry into the area. Present-day Khoekhoe-speaking Namaqua (or Nama in short) pastoralists show high proportions of East African admixture, linking the East African ancestry with Khoekhoe herders. Most other historical Khoekhoe populations have, however, disappeared over the last few centuries and their contribution to the genetic structure of present-day populations is not well understood. In our study, we analyzed genome-wide autosomal and full mitochondrial data from a population who trace their ancestry to the Khoekhoe-speaking Hessequa herders from the southern Cape region of what is now South Africa.\n\nWe generated genome-wide data from 162 individuals and mitochondrial DNA data of a subset of 87 individuals, sampled in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, where the Hessequa population once lived. Using available comparative data from Khoe-speaking and related groups, we aligned genetic date estimates and admixture proportions to the archaeological proposed dates and routes for the arrival of the East African pastoralists in southern Africa. We identified several Afro-Asiatic-speaking pastoralist groups from Ethiopia and Tanzania who share high affinities with the East African ancestry present in southern Africa. We also found that the East African pastoralist expansion was heavily male-biased, akin to a pastoralist migration previously observed on the genetic level in ancient Europe, by which Pontic-Caspian Steppe pastoralist groups represented by the Yamnaya culture spread across the Eurasian continent during the late Neolithic/Bronze Age.\n\nWe propose that pastoralism in southern Africa arrived through male-biased migration of an East African Afro-Asiatic-related group(s) who introduced new subsistence and livestock practices to local southern African hunter-gatherers. Our results add to the understanding of historical human migration and mobility in Africa, connected to the spread of food-producing and livestock practices.",

    "abstract": "Müllerian mimicry rings are remarkable symbiotic species assemblages in which multiple members share a similar phenotype. However, their evolutionary origin remains poorly understood. Although gene flow among species has been shown to generate mimetic patterns in some Heliconius butterflies, mimicry is believed to be due to true convergence without gene flow in many other cases. We investigated the evolutionary history of multiple members of a passerine mimicry ring in the poisonous Papuan pitohuis. Previous phylogenetic evidence indicates that the aposematic coloration shared by many, but not all, members of this genus is ancestral and has only been retained by members of the mimicry ring. Using a newly assembled genome and thousands of genomic DNA markers, we demonstrate gene flow from the hooded pitohui (Pitohui dichrous) into the southern variable pitohui (Pitohui uropygialis), consistent with shared patterns of aposematic coloration. The vicinity of putatively introgressed loci is significantly enriched for genes that are important in melanin pigment expression and toxin resistance, suggesting that gene flow may have been instrumental in the sharing of plumage patterns and toxicity. These results indicate that interspecies gene flow may be a more general mechanism in generating mimicry rings than hitherto appreciated.",

    "title": "Stage-specific transposon activity in the life cycle of the fairy-ring mushroom <i>Marasmius oreades</i>.",
    "abstract": "Genetic variability can be generated by different mechanisms, and across the life cycle. Many basidiomycete fungi have an extended somatic stage, during which each cell carries two genetically distinct haploid nuclei (dikaryosis), resulting from fusion of two compatible monokaryotic individuals. Recent findings have revealed remarkable genome stability at the nucleotide level during dikaryotic growth in these organisms, but whether this pattern extends to mutations affecting large genomic regions remains unknown. Furthermore, despite high genome integrity during dikaryosis, basidiomycete populations are not devoid of genetic diversity, begging the question of when this diversity is introduced. Here, we used a <i>Marasmius oreades</i> fairy ring to investigate the rise of large-scale variants during mono- and dikaryosis. By separating the two nuclear genotypes from four fruiting bodies and generating complete genome assemblies, we gained access to investigate genomic changes of any size. We found that during dikaryotic growth in nature the genome stayed intact, but after separating the nucleotypes into monokaryons, a considerable amount of structural variation started to accumulate, driven to large extent by transposons. Transposon insertions were also found in monokaryotic single-meiospore isolates. Hence, we show that genome integrity in basidiomycetes can be interrupted during monokaryosis, leading to genomic rearrangements and increased activity of transposable elements. We suggest that genetic diversification is disproportionate between life cycle stages in mushroom-forming fungi, so that the short-lived monokaryotic growth stage is more prone to genetic changes than the dikaryotic stage.",

    "title": "Single-nuclei transcriptomes from human adrenal gland reveal distinct cellular identities of low and high-risk neuroblastoma tumors.",
    "abstract": "Childhood neuroblastoma has a remarkable variability in outcome. Age at diagnosis is one of the most important prognostic factors, with children less than 1 year old having favorable outcomes. Here we study single-cell and single-nuclei transcriptomes of neuroblastoma with different clinical risk groups and stages, including healthy adrenal gland. We compare tumor cell populations with embryonic mouse sympatho-adrenal derivatives, and post-natal human adrenal gland. We provide evidence that low and high-risk neuroblastoma have different cell identities, representing two disease entities. Low-risk neuroblastoma presents a transcriptome that resembles sympatho- and chromaffin cells, whereas malignant cells enriched in high-risk neuroblastoma resembles a subtype of TRKB+ cholinergic progenitor population identified in human post-natal gland. Analyses of these populations reveal different gene expression programs for worst and better survival in correlation with age at diagnosis. Our findings reveal two cellular identities and a composition of human neuroblastoma tumors reflecting clinical heterogeneity and outcome.",

    "title": "SF3B1 mutation identifies a distinct subset of myelodysplastic syndrome with ring sideroblasts.",
    "abstract": "Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by isolated erythroid dysplasia and 15% or more bone marrow ring sideroblasts. Ring sideroblasts are found also in other MDS subtypes, such as refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS). A high prevalence of somatic mutations of SF3B1 was reported in these conditions. To identify mutation patterns that affect disease phenotype and clinical outcome, we performed a comprehensive mutation analysis in 293 patients with myeloid neoplasm and 1% or more ring sideroblasts. SF3B1 mutations were detected in 129 of 159 cases (81%) of RARS or RCMD-RS. Among other patients with ring sideroblasts, lower prevalence of SF3B1 mutations and higher prevalence of mutations in other splicing factor genes were observed (P < .001). In multivariable analyses, patients with SF3B1 mutations showed significantly better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], .37; P = .003) and lower cumulative incidence of disease progression (HR = 0.31; P = .018) compared with SF3B1-unmutated cases. The independent prognostic value of SF3B1 mutation was retained in MDS without excess blasts, as well as in sideroblastic categories (RARS and RCMD-RS). Among SF3B1-mutated patients, coexisting mutations in DNA methylation genes were associated with multilineage dysplasia (P = .015) but had no effect on clinical outcome. TP53 mutations were frequently detected in patients without SF3B1 mutation, and were associated with poor outcome. Thus, SF3B1 mutation identifies a distinct MDS subtype that is unlikely to develop detrimental subclonal mutations and is characterized by indolent clinical course and favorable outcome.",

    "title": "Analysis of the Human Prostate-Specific Proteome Defined by Transcriptomics and Antibody-Based Profiling Identifies TMEM79 and ACOXL as Two Putative, Diagnostic Markers in Prostate Cancer.",
    "abstract": "To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL.",

Here, we asked about the genetic basis of parallel divergence in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis, which has repeatedly evolved coexisting ecotypes adapted to either crab predation or wave action. We sequenced the transcriptome of snails of both ecotypes from three distant geographical locations (Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) and mapped the reads to the L. saxatilis reference genome. We identified genomic regions potentially under divergent selection between ecotypes within each country, using an outlier approach based on F(ST) values calculated per locus. In line with previous studies indicating that gene reuse is generally common, we expected to find extensive sharing of outlier loci due to recent shared ancestry and gene flow between at least two of the locations in our study system. Contrary to our expectations, we found that most outliers were country specific, suggesting that much of the genetic basis of divergence is not shared among locations. However, we did find that more outliers were shared than expected by chance and that differentiation of shared outliers is often generated by the same SNPs. We discuss two mechanisms potentially explaining the limited amount of sharing we observed. First, a polygenic basis of divergent traits might allow for multiple distinct molecular mechanisms generating the same phenotypic patterns. Second, additional, location-specific axes of selection that we did not focus on in this study may produce distinct patterns of genetic divergence within each site.",

    "title": "Complex population structure of the Atlantic puffin revealed by whole genome analyses.",
    "abstract": "The factors underlying gene flow and genomic population structure in vagile seabirds are notoriously difficult to understand due to their complex ecology with diverse dispersal barriers and extensive periods at sea. Yet, such understanding is vital for conservation management of seabirds that are globally declining at alarming rates. Here, we elucidate the population structure of the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) by assembling its reference genome and analyzing genome-wide resequencing data of 72 individuals from 12 colonies. We identify four large, genetically distinct clusters, observe isolation-by-distance between colonies within these clusters, and obtain evidence for a secondary contact zone. These observations disagree with the current taxonomy, and show that a complex set of contemporary biotic factors impede gene flow over different spatial scales. Our results highlight the power of whole genome data to reveal unexpected population structure in vagile marine seabirds and its value for seabird taxonomy, evolution and conservation.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that genetic aberrations involving the special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) gene result in a variable phenotype of syndromic intellectual disability. Although only a small number of patients have been described, there is already considerable variation in regard to the underlying molecular mechanism spanning from structural variation to point mutations. We here describe a male patient with intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, cleft palate, malformed teeth, and oligodontia. Array CGH analysis identified a small intragenic duplication in the SATB2 gene that included three coding exons. The result was confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and low coverage whole genome mate pair sequencing. WGS breakpoint analysis directly confirmed the duplication as intragenic. This is the first reported patient with an intragenic duplication in SATB2 in combination with a phenotype that is highly similar to previously described patients with small deletions or point mutations of the same gene. Our findings expand the spectra of SATB2 mutations and confirm the presence of a distinct SATB2-phenotype with severe ID and speech impairment, cleft palate and/or high arched palate, and abnormalities of the teeth. For patients that present with this clinical picture, a high-resolution exon targeted array CGH and/or WGS, in addition to sequencing of SATB2, should be considered.",

    "title": "Rare tandem repeat expansions associate with genes involved in synaptic and neuronal signaling functions in schizophrenia.",
    "abstract": "Tandem repeat expansions (TREs) are associated with over 60 monogenic disorders and have recently been implicated in complex disorders such as cancer and autism spectrum disorder. The role of TREs in schizophrenia is now emerging. In this study, we have performed a genome-wide investigation of TREs in schizophrenia. Using genome sequence data from 1154 Swedish schizophrenia cases and 934 ancestry-matched population controls, we have detected genome-wide rare (<0.1% population frequency) TREs that have motifs with a length of 2-20 base pairs. We find that the proportion of individuals carrying rare TREs is significantly higher in the schizophrenia group. There is a significantly higher burden of rare TREs in schizophrenia cases than in controls in genic regions, particularly in postsynaptic genes, in genes overlapping brain expression quantitative trait loci, and in brain-expressed genes that are differentially expressed between schizophrenia cases and controls. We demonstrate that TRE-associated genes are more constrained and primarily impact synaptic and neuronal signaling functions. These results have been replicated in an independent Canadian sample that consisted of 252 schizophrenia cases of European ancestry and 222 ancestry-matched controls. Our results support the involvement of rare TREs in schizophrenia etiology.",

    "title": "Global genome splicing analysis reveals an increased number of alternatively spliced genes with aging.",
    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism for the development of different tissues; however, not much is known about changes to alternative splicing during aging. Splicing events may become more frequent and widespread genome-wide as tissues age and the splicing machinery stringency decreases. Using skin, skeletal muscle, bone, thymus, and white adipose tissue from wild-type C57BL6/J male mice (4 and 18 months old), we examined the effect of age on splicing by AS analysis of the differential exon usage of the genome. The results identified a considerable number of AS genes in skeletal muscle, thymus, bone, and white adipose tissue between the different age groups (ranging from 27 to 246 AS genes corresponding to 0.3-3.2% of the total number of genes analyzed). For skin, skeletal muscle, and bone, we included a later age group (28 months old) that showed that the number of alternatively spliced genes increased with age in all three tissues (P < 0.01). Analysis of alternatively spliced genes across all tissues by gene ontology and pathway analysis identified 158 genes involved in RNA processing. Additional analysis of AS in a mouse model for the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome was performed. The results show that expression of the mutant protein, progerin, is associated with an impaired developmental splicing. As progerin accumulates, the number of genes with AS increases compared to in wild-type skin. Our results indicate the existence of a mechanism for increased AS during aging in several tissues, emphasizing that AS has a more important role in the aging process than previously known.",

    "title": "DNA Methylation-Based Interferon Scores Associate With Sub-Phenotypes in Primary Sjögren's Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease with profound clinical heterogeneity, where excessive activation of the type I interferon (IFN) system is considered one of the key mechanisms in disease pathogenesis. Here we present a DNA methylation-based IFN system activation score (DNAm IFN score) and investigate its potential associations with sub-phenotypes of pSS. The study comprised 100 Swedish patients with pSS and 587 Swedish controls. For replication, 48 patients with pSS from Stavanger, Norway, were included. IFN scores were calculated from DNA methylation levels at the IFN-induced genes RSAD2, IFIT1 and IFI44L. A high DNAm IFN score, defined as > meancontrols +2SDcontrols (IFN score >4.4), was observed in 59% of pSS patients and in 4% of controls (p=1.3x10-35). Patients with a high DNAm IFN score were on average seven years younger at symptom onset (p=0.017) and at diagnosis (p=3x10-3). The DNAm IFN score levels were significantly higher in pSS positive for both SSA and SSB antibodies compared to SSA/SSB negative patients (pdiscovery=1.9x10-8, preplication=7.8x10-4). In patients positive for both SSA subtypes Ro52 and Ro60, an increased score was identified compared to single positive patients (p=0.022). Analyzing the discovery and replication cohorts together, elevated DNAm IFN scores were observed in pSS with hypergammaglobulinemia (p=2x10-8) and low C4 (p=1.5x10-3) compared to patients without these manifestations. Patients < 70 years with ongoing lymphoma at DNA sampling or lymphoma at follow-up (n=7), presented an increased DNAm IFN score compared to pSS without lymphoma (p=0.025). In conclusion, the DNAm-based IFN score is a promising alternative to mRNA-based scores for identification of patients with activation of the IFN system and may be applied for patient stratification guiding treatment decisions, monitoring and inclusion in clinical trials.",

    "title": "Induced somatic mutation accumulation during skeletal muscle regeneration reduces muscle strength.",
    "abstract": "Aging is associated with a progressive decline in tissue function and regenerative capacity, partly due to genomic instability, one of the hallmarks of aging1,2. Genomic instability encompasses DNA damage and the accumulation of somatic mutations in post-zygotic cells, yet the specific impact of these mutations on age-related tissue dysfunction remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed a mouse model in which genomic instability was induced specifically in muscle progenitor cells3 through targeted deletion of the Msh2 (ref. 4) and Blm5 genes. This allowed us to assess how elevated DNA damage and somatic mutations, from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to structural variants, affect muscle regeneration following injury. These mice exhibited impaired muscle regeneration, characterized by smaller muscle fibers, reduced muscle mass gain and decreased grip strength. Importantly, similar muscle deficits were observed in a second mouse model where somatic mutations were elevated with less substantial DNA damage. These findings provide evidence that the accumulation of somatic mutations can potentially compromise the function of somatic cells, contributing to the aging phenotype in skeletal muscle.",

    "title": "From cytogenetics to cytogenomics: whole-genome sequencing as a first-line test comprehensively captures the diverse spectrum of disease-causing genetic variation underlying intellectual disability.",
    "abstract": "Since different types of genetic variants, from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to large chromosomal rearrangements, underlie intellectual disability, we evaluated the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) rather than chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) as a first-line genetic diagnostic test.\n\nWe analyzed three cohorts with short-read WGS: (i) a retrospective cohort with validated copy number variants (CNVs) (cohort 1, n = 68), (ii) individuals referred for monogenic multi-gene panels (cohort 2, n = 156), and (iii) 100 prospective, consecutive cases referred to our center for CMA (cohort 3). Bioinformatic tools developed include FindSV, SVDB, Rhocall, Rhoviz, and vcf2cytosure.\n\nFirst, we validated our structural variant (SV)-calling pipeline on cohort 1, consisting of three trisomies and 79 deletions and duplications with a median size of 850 kb (min 500 bp, max 155 Mb). All variants were detected. Second, we utilized the same pipeline in cohort 2 and analyzed with monogenic WGS panels, increasing the diagnostic yield to 8%. Next, cohort 3 was analyzed by both CMA and WGS. The WGS data was processed for large (> 10 kb) SVs genome-wide and for exonic SVs and SNVs in a panel of 887 genes linked to intellectual disability as well as genes matched to patient-specific Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) phenotypes. This yielded a total of 25 pathogenic variants (SNVs or SVs), of which 12 were detected by CMA as well. We also applied short tandem repeat (STR) expansion detection and discovered one pathologic expansion in ATXN7. Finally, a case of Prader-Willi syndrome with uniparental disomy (UPD) was validated in the WGS data. Important positional information was obtained in all cohorts. Remarkably, 7% of the analyzed cases harbored complex structural variants, as exemplified by a ring chromosome and two duplications found to be an insertional translocation and part of a cryptic unbalanced translocation, respectively.\n\nThe overall diagnostic rate of 27% was more than doubled compared to clinical microarray (12%). Using WGS, we detected a wide range of SVs with high accuracy. Since the WGS data also allowed for analysis of SNVs, UPD, and STRs, it represents a powerful comprehensive genetic test in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting.",

    "title": "Philippine Ayta possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world.",
    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence show that modern humans interbred with archaic Denisovans. Here, we report an account of shared demographic history between Australasians and Denisovans distinctively in Island Southeast Asia. Our analyses are based on ∼2.3 million genotypes from 118 ethnic groups of the Philippines, including 25 diverse self-identified Negrito populations, along with high-coverage genomes of Australopapuans and Ayta Magbukon Negritos. We show that Ayta Magbukon possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world-∼30%-40% greater than that of Australians and Papuans-consistent with an independent admixture event into Negritos from Denisovans. Together with the recently described Homo luzonensis, we suggest that there were multiple archaic species that inhabited the Philippines prior to the arrival of modern humans and that these archaic groups may have been genetically related. Altogether, our findings unveil a complex intertwined history of modern and archaic humans in the Asia-Pacific region, where distinct Islander Denisovan populations differentially admixed with incoming Australasians across multiple locations and at various points in time.",

    "title": "Disease-specific U1 spliceosomal RNA mutations in mature B-cell neoplasms.",
    "abstract": "Recurrent mutations in the third base of U1 spliceosomal RNA responsible for marked splicing and expression abnormalities have been described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and some solid tumors. However, the clinical significance of these mutations in large and independent CLL cohorts as well as their presence in other B-cell neoplasms is unknown. Here we characterized U1 mutations in 1670 CLL and 363 mature B-cell lymphomas. We confirmed that the g.3A>C U1 mutation is found in 3.5% of CLL, which conferred rapid disease progression independently of the main biological and clinical prognostic markers of the disease. Additionally, a recurrent g.9C>T mutation was found in 1.5% of CLL causing downstream splicing alterations and associated with adverse prognosis. We also identified a g.4C>T mutation in 10% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the germinal center subtype and a g.7A>G mutation in 30% of EBV-negative Burkitt lymphomas, both of which altered the splicing pattern of multiple genes. This study reveals novel, recurrent, and tumor-specific U1 mutations in mature B-cell neoplasms with biological and prognostic implications, thus establishing U1 as a novel pan-B-cell malignancy driver gene.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the red clover (Trifolium pratense) root-associated microbiota to clarify the presence of pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms in 89 Swedish field sites.\r\n\r\n16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing analysis were performed on DNA extracted from the red clover root samples collected to determine the composition of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic root-associated microbe communities. Alpha and beta diversities were calculated and relative abundance of various microbial taxa and their co-occurrence were analyzed. Rhizobium was the most prevalent bacterial genus, followed by Sphingomonas, Mucilaginibacter, Flavobacterium, and the unclassified Chloroflexi group KD4-96. The Leptodontidium, Cladosporium, Clonostachys, and Tetracladium fungal genera known for endophytic, saprotrophic, and mycoparasitic lifestyles were also frequently observed in all samples. Sixty-two potential pathogenic fungi were identified with a bias toward grass pathogens and a higher abundance in samples from conventional farms.\r\n\r\nWe showed that the microbial community was mainly shaped by geographic location and management procedures. Co-occurrence networks revealed that the Rhizobiumleguminosarum bv. trifolii was negatively associated with all fungal pathogenic taxa recognized in this study.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the microbiota may be considered as an environmental factor that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Periodontal disease has been associated with cardio- and cerebrovascular events, and inflammation in the periodontium is suggested to increase the systemic inflammatory level of the host, which may in turn influence plaque composition and rupture. We previously showed that bacteria from the oral cavity and the gut could be found in atherosclerotic plaques.\n\nTo elucidate whether the oral microbiota composition differed between patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic atherosclerosis we performed pyrosequencing of the oral microbiota of 92 individuals including patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic atherosclerosis and control individuals without carotid plaques or previous stroke or myocardial infarction.\n\nThe overall microbial structure was similar in controls and atherosclerosis patients, but patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis had higher relative abundance of Anaeroglobus (mean 0.040% (SD 0.049)) than the control group (0.010% (SD 0.028)) (P = 0.03). Using linear regression analysis, we found that Parvimonas associated positively with uCRP and Capnocytophaga, Catonella and Lactobacillus associated with blood lipid markers. In conclusion, abundance of Anaeroglobus in the oral cavity could be associated with symptomatic atherosclerosis.",

    "title": "Stop codon readthrough alters the activity of a POU/Oct transcription factor during Drosophila development.",
    "abstract": "A number of cellular processes have evolved in metazoans that increase the proteome repertoire in relation to the genome, such as alternative splicing and translation recoding. Another such process, translational stop codon readthrough (SCR), generates C-terminally extended protein isoforms in many eukaryotes, including yeast, plants, insects, and humans. While comparative genome analyses have predicted the existence of programmed SCR in many species including humans, experimental proof of its functional consequences are scarce.\n\nWe show that SCR of the Drosophila POU/Oct transcription factor Ventral veins lacking/Drifter (Vvl/Dfr) mRNA is prevalent in certain tissues in vivo, reaching a rate of 50% in the larval prothoracic gland. Phylogenetically, the C-terminal extension is conserved and harbors intrinsically disordered regions and amino acid stretches implied in transcriptional activation. Elimination of Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis changed the expression of a large number of downstream genes involved in processes such as chromatin regulation, neurogenesis, development, and immune response. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that the C-terminal extension of Vvl/Dfr is necessary for correct timing of pupariation, by increasing the capacity to regulate its target genes. The extended Vvl/Dfr isoform acts in synergy with the transcription factor Molting defective (Mld) to increase the expression and biosynthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone, thereby advancing pupariation. Consequently, late-stage larval development was prolonged and metamorphosis delayed in vvl/dfr readthrough mutants.\n\nWe demonstrate that translational recoding of a POU/Oct transcription factor takes place in a highly tissue-specific and temporally controlled manner. This dynamic and regulated recoding is necessary for normal expression of a large number of genes involved in many cellular and developmental processes. Loss of Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough negatively affects steroid hormone biosynthesis and delays larval development and progression into metamorphosis. Thus, this study demonstrates how SCR of a transcription factor can act as a developmental switch in a spatiotemporal manner, feeding into the timing of developmental transitions between different life-cycle stages.",

    "abstract": "After performing de novo transcript assembly of >1 billion RNA-Sequencing reads obtained from 22 samples of different Norway spruce (Picea abies) tissues that were not surface sterilized, we found that assembled sequences captured a mix of plant, lichen, and fungal transcripts. The latter were likely expressed by endophytic and epiphytic symbionts, indicating that these organisms were present, alive, and metabolically active. Here, we show that these serendipitously sequenced transcripts need not be considered merely as contamination, as is common, but that they provide insight into the plant's phyllosphere. Notably, we could classify these transcripts as originating predominantly from Dothideomycetes and Leotiomycetes species, with functional annotation of gene families indicating active growth and metabolism, with particular regards to glucose intake and processing, as well as gene regulation.",

    "title": "FOXO-regulated OSER1 reduces oxidative stress and extends lifespan in multiple species.",
    "abstract": "FOXO transcription factors modulate aging-related pathways and influence longevity in multiple species, but the transcriptional targets that mediate these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved FOXO target gene, Oxidative stress-responsive serine-rich protein 1 (OSER1), whose overexpression extends lifespan in silkworms, nematodes, and flies, while its depletion correspondingly shortens lifespan. In flies, overexpression of OSER1 increases resistance to oxidative stress, starvation, and heat shock, while OSER1-depleted flies are more vulnerable to these stressors. In silkworms, hydrogen peroxide both induces and is scavenged by OSER1 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of OSER1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to increased ROS production and shorter lifespan, mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased ATP production, and altered transcription of mitochondrial genes. Human proteomic analysis suggests that OSER1 plays roles in oxidative stress response, cellular senescence, and reproduction, which is consistent with the data and suggests that OSER1 could play a role in fertility in silkworms and nematodes. Human studies demonstrate that polymorphic variants in OSER1 are associated with human longevity. In summary, OSER1 is an evolutionarily conserved FOXO-regulated protein that improves resistance to oxidative stress, maintains mitochondrial functional integrity, and increases lifespan in multiple species. Additional studies will clarify the role of OSER1 as a critical effector of healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are the gold standard for tissue preservation in clinical and research settings. Current single-cell chromatin accessibility technologies cannot resolve cell-type-specific epigenetic profiles in FFPE tissues due to extensive DNA damage. We present scFFPE-ATAC, a high-throughput single-cell chromatin accessibility assay for FFPE samples that integrates an FFPE-adapted Tn5 transposase, ultra-high-throughput DNA barcoding (>56 million barcodes per run), T7 promoter-mediated DNA damage repair, and in vitro transcription. We benchmark scFFPE-ATAC on FFPE mouse spleen and validate its performance against fresh tissue. We apply it to human lymph node samples archived for 8-12 years and to lung cancer FFPE tissues, revealing distinct regulatory trajectories between tumor center and invasive edge. Analysis of archived follicular lymphoma and transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma samples identifies relapse- and transformation-associated epigenetic dynamics. scFFPE-ATAC enables retrospective, spatial, and mechanistic epigenetic studies in long-term archived specimens.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal variations in retrovirus-host interactions among Darwin's finches.",
    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are inherited remnants of retroviruses that colonized host germline over millions of years, providing a sampling of retroviral diversity across time. Here, we utilize the strength of Darwin's finches, a system synonymous with evolutionary studies, for investigating ERV history, revealing recent retrovirus-host interactions in natural populations. By mapping ERV variation across all species of Darwin's finches and comparing with outgroup species, we highlight geographical and historical patterns of retrovirus-host occurrence, utilizing the system for evaluating the extent and timing of retroviral activity in hosts undergoing adaptive radiation and colonization of new environments. We find shared ERVs among all samples indicating retrovirus-host associations pre-dating host speciation, as well as considerable ERV variation across populations of the entire Darwin's finches' radiation. Unexpected ERV variation in finch species on different islands suggests historical changes in gene flow and selection. Non-random distribution of ERVs along and between chromosomes, and across finch species, suggests association between ERV accumulation and the rapid speciation of Darwin's finches.",

    "abstract": "The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family is involved in pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular (CV) diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between circulating VEGF ligands and/or soluble receptors and CV outcome in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and chronic coronary syndrome (CCS).\n\nLevels of VEGF biomarkers, including bFGF, Flt-1, KDR (VEGFR2), PlGF, Tie-2, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D, were measured in the PLATO ACS cohort (n = 2091, discovery cohort). Subsequently, VEGF-D was also measured in the STABILITY CCS cohort (n = 4015, confirmation cohort) to verify associations with CV outcomes. Associations between plasma VEGF-D and outcomes were analysed by multiple Cox regression models with hazard ratios (HR [95% CI]) comparing the upper vs. the lower quartile of VEGF-D. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of VEGF-D in PLATO identified SNPs that were used as genetic instruments in Mendelian randomization (MR) meta-analyses vs. clinical endpoints. GWAS and MR were performed in patients with ACS from PLATO (n = 10 013) and FRISC-II (n = 2952), and with CCS from the STABILITY trial (n = 10 786). VEGF-D, KDR, Flt-1, and PlGF showed significant association with CV outcomes. VEGF-D was most strongly associated with CV death (P = 3.73e-05, HR 1.892 [1.419, 2.522]). Genome-wide significant associations with VEGF-D levels were identified at the VEGFD locus on chromosome Xp22. MR analyses of the combined top ranked SNPs (GWAS P-values; rs192812042, P = 5.82e-20; rs234500, P = 1.97e-14) demonstrated a significant effect on CV mortality [P = 0.0257, HR 1.81 (1.07, 3.04) per increase of one unit in log VEGF-D].\n\nThis is the first large-scale cohort study to demonstrate that both VEGF-D plasma levels and VEGFD genetic variants are independently associated with CV outcomes in patients with ACS and CCS. Measurements of VEGF-D levels and/or VEGFD genetic variants may provide incremental prognostic information in patients with ACS and CCS.",

    "title": "Nitrogenase gene amplicons from global marine surface waters are dominated by genes of non-cyanobacteria.",
    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are thought to be the main N(2)-fixing organisms (diazotrophs) in marine pelagic waters, but recent molecular analyses indicate that non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are also present and active. Existing data are, however, restricted geographically and by limited sequencing depths. Our analysis of 79,090 nitrogenase (nifH) PCR amplicons encoding 7,468 unique proteins from surface samples (ten DNA samples and two RNA samples) collected at ten marine locations world-wide provides the first in-depth survey of a functional bacterial gene and yield insights into the composition and diversity of the nifH gene pool in marine waters. Great divergence in nifH composition was observed between sites. Cyanobacteria-like genes were most frequent among amplicons from the warmest waters, but overall the data set was dominated by nifH sequences most closely related to non-cyanobacteria. Clusters related to Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacteria were most common and showed distinct geographic distributions. Sequences related to anaerobic bacteria (nifH Cluster III) were generally rare, but preponderant in cold waters, especially in the Arctic. Although the two transcript samples were dominated by unicellular cyanobacteria, 42% of the identified non-cyanobacterial nifH clusters from the corresponding DNA samples were also detected in cDNA. The study indicates that non-cyanobacteria account for a substantial part of the nifH gene pool in marine surface waters and that these genes are at least occasionally expressed. The contribution of non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs to the global N(2) fixation budget cannot be inferred from sequence data alone, but the prevalence of non-cyanobacterial nifH genes and transcripts suggest that these bacteria are ecologically significant.",

    "abstract": "Endomyocardial biopsy is a valuable tool in cardiac diagnostics but is limited by low diagnostic yield and significant complication risks. Meanwhile, recent developments in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies promise a wealth of biological data from minimal tissue samples. To take advantage of the minimal tissue amount needed for molecular analyses, we have developed a sub-millimeter endovascular biopsy device, considerably smaller than current clinical equipment, and devised a low-input RNA-sequencing protocol for analyzing small tissue samples. In in vivo evaluation in swine, 81% of biopsy attempts (n = 157) were successful. High quality RNA-sequencing data was generated from 91% of the sequenced cardiac micro-biopsy samples (n = 32). Gene expression signatures of samples taken with the novel device were comparable with a conventional device. No major complications were detected either during procedures or during 7 days' follow-up, despite acquiring a relatively large number of biopsies (median 30) in each animal. In conclusion, the novel device coupled with RNA-sequencing provides a feasible method to obtain molecular data from the myocardium. The method is less traumatic and has a higher flexibility compared to conventional methods, enabling safer and more targeted sampling from different parts of the myocardium.",

    "title": "Comparative proteomic analyses of potato leaves from field-grown plants grown under extremely long days.",
    "abstract": "There are limited molecular data and few biomarkers available for studies of field-grown plants, especially for plants grown during extremely long days. In this study we present quantitative proteomics data from 3 years of field trials on potato, conducted in northern and southern Sweden and analyze over 3000 proteins per year of the study and complement the proteomic analysis with metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses. Small but consistent differences linked to the longer days (an average of four more hours of light per day) in northern Sweden (20 h light/day) compared to southern Sweden can be observed, with a high correlation between the mRNA determined by RNA-seq and protein abundances. The majority of the proteins with differential abundances between northern and southern Sweden could be divided into three groups: metabolic enzymes (especially GABA metabolism), proteins involved in redox metabolism, and hydrolytic enzymes. The observed differences in metabolic enzyme abundances corresponded well with untargeted metabolite data determined by GC and LC mass-spectrometry. We also analyzed differences in protein abundance between potato varieties that performed relatively well in northern Sweden in terms of yield with those that performed relatively less well. This comparison indicates that the proteins with higher abundance in the high-yield quotient group are more anabolic in their character, whereas the proteins with lower abundance are more catabolic. Our results create a base of information about potato \"field-omics\" for improved understanding of physiological and molecular processes in field-grown plants, and our data indicate that the potato plant is not generally stressed by extremely long days.",

    "title": "Shared requirement for MYC upstream super-enhancer region in tissue regeneration and cancer.",
    "abstract": "Cancer has been characterized as a wound that does not heal. Malignant cells are morphologically distinct from normal proliferating cells but have extensive similarities to tissues undergoing wound healing and/or regeneration. The mechanistic basis of this similarity has, however, remained enigmatic. Here, we show that the genomic region upstream of Myc, which carries more cancer susceptibility in humans than any other genomic region, is required for intestinal regeneration after radiation damage. Failure to regenerate is associated with inefficient Ly6a/Sca1+ stem/progenitor cell mobilization, and almost complete failure to re-establish Lgr5+ cell compartment in the intestinal crypts. The Myc upstream region is also critical for growth of adult intestinal cells in 3D organoid culture. We show that culture conditions recapitulating most aspects of adult normal tissue architecture still reprogram normal cells to proliferate using a mechanism similar to that employed by cancer cells. Our results establish a function for the Myc super-enhancer region as the genetic link between tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis, and demonstrates that normal tissue renewal and regeneration of tissues after severe damage are mechanistically distinct.2-540",

    "title": "Variations of gastric corpus microbiota are associated with early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and squamous dysplasia.",
    "abstract": "Observational studies revealed a relationship between changes in gastric mucosa and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) which suggested a possible role for gastric microbiota in ESCC carcinogenesis. In this study we aimed to compare pattern of gastric corpus microbiota in ESCC with normal esophagus. Cases were included subjects with early ESCC (stage I-II) and esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) as the cancer precursor. Control groups included age and sex-matched subjects with mid-esophagus esophagitis (diseased-control), and histologically normal esophagus (healthy-control). DNA was extracted from snap-frozen gastric corpus tissues and 16S rRNA was sequenced on GS-FLX Titanium. After noise removal, an average of 3004 reads per sample was obtained from 93 subjects. We applied principal coordinate analysis to ordinate distances from beta diversity data. Pattern of gastric microbiota using Unifrac (p = 0.004) and weighted Unifrac distances (p = 0.018) statistically varied between cases and healthy controls. Sequences were aligned to SILVA database and Clostridiales and Erysipelotrichales orders were more abundant among cases after controling for multiple testing (p = 0.011). No such difference was observed between mid-esophagitis and healthy controls. This study is the first to show that composition of gastric corpus mucosal microbiota differs in early ESCC and ESD from healthy esophagus.",

    "abstract": "*Here, species composition and biomass production of actively growing ectomycorrhizal (EM) mycelia were studied over the rotation period of managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands in south-western Sweden. *The EM mycelia were collected using ingrowth mesh bags incubated in the forest soil during one growing season. Fungal biomass was estimated by ergosterol analysis and the EM species were identified by 454 sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons. Nutrient availability and the fungal biomass in soil samples were also estimated. *Biomass production peaked in young stands (10-30 yr old) before the first thinning phase. Tylospora fibrillosa dominated the EM community, especially in these young stands, where it constituted 80% of the EM amplicons derived from the mesh bags. Species richness increased in older stands. *The establishment of EM mycelial networks in young Norway spruce stands requires large amounts of carbon, while much less is needed to sustain the EM community in older stands. The variation in EM biomass production over the rotation period has implications for carbon sequestration rates in forest soils.",

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs.\n\nTo identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs.\n\nNo significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 × 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-γ signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors.\n\nOur findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD.",

    "title": "Evaluation of genetic demultiplexing of single-cell sequencing data from model species.",
    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (sc-seq) provides a species agnostic tool to study cellular processes. However, these technologies are expensive and require sufficient cell quantities and biological replicates to avoid artifactual results. An option to address these problems is pooling cells from multiple individuals into one sc-seq library. In humans, genotype-based computational separation (i.e., demultiplexing) of pooled sc-seq samples is common. This approach would be instrumental for studying non-isogenic model organisms. We set out to determine whether genotype-based demultiplexing could be more broadly applied among species ranging from zebrafish to non-human primates. Using such non-isogenic species, we benchmark genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq datasets against various ground truths. We demonstrate that genotype-based demultiplexing of pooled sc-seq samples can be used with confidence in several non-isogenic model organisms and uncover limitations of this method. Importantly, the only genomic resource required for this approach is sc-seq data and a de novo transcriptome. The incorporation of pooling into sc-seq study designs will decrease cost while simultaneously increasing the reproducibility and experimental options in non-isogenic model organisms.",

    "title": "Genomics of severe and treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with deep brain stimulation: A preliminary investigation.",
    "abstract": "Individuals with severe and treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (trOCD) represent a small but severely disabled group of patients. Since trOCD cases eligible for deep brain stimulation (DBS) probably comprise the most severe end of the OCD spectrum, we hypothesize that they may be more likely to have a strong genetic contribution to their disorder. Therefore, while the worldwide population of DBS-treated cases may be small (~300), screening these individuals with modern genomic methods may accelerate gene discovery in OCD. As such, we have begun to collect DNA from trOCD cases who qualify for DBS, and here we report results from whole exome sequencing and microarray genotyping of our first five cases. All participants had previously received DBS in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), with two patients responding to the surgery and one showing a partial response. Our analyses focused on gene-disruptive rare variants (GDRVs; rare, predicted-deleterious single-nucleotide variants or copy number variants overlapping protein-coding genes). Three of the five cases carried a GDRV, including a missense variant in the ion transporter domain of KCNB1, a deletion at 15q11.2, and a duplication at 15q26.1. The KCNB1 variant (hg19 chr20-47991077-C-T, NM_004975.3:c.1020G>A, p.Met340Ile) causes substitution of methionine for isoleucine in the trans-membrane region of neuronal potassium voltage-gated ion channel KV2.1. This KCNB1 substitution (Met340Ile) is located in a highly constrained region of the protein where other rare missense variants have previously been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The patient carrying the Met340Ile variant responded to DBS, which suggests that genetic factors could potentially be predictors of treatment response in DBS for OCD. In sum, we have established a protocol for recruiting and genomically characterizing trOCD cases. Preliminary results suggest that this will be an informative strategy for finding risk genes in OCD.",

    "abstract": "Clonal deconvolution of mutational landscapes is crucial to understand the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. Two limiting factors for clonal deconvolution that have remained unresolved are variation in purity and chromosomal copy number across different samples of the same tumor. We developed a semi-supervised algorithm that tracks variant calls through multi-sample spatiotemporal tumor data. While normalizing allele frequencies based on purity, it also adjusts for copy number changes at clonal deconvolution. Absent à priori copy number data, it renders in silico copy number estimations from bulk sequences. Using published and simulated tumor sequences, we reliably segregated clonal/subclonal variants even at a low sequencing depth (~50×). Given at least one pure tumor sample (>70% purity), we could normalize and deconvolve paired samples down to a purity of 40%. This renders a reliable clonal reconstruction well adapted to multi-regionally sampled solid tumors, which are often aneuploid and contaminated by non-cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Bacterioplankton are main drivers of biogeochemical cycles and important components of aquatic food webs. While sequencing-based studies have revealed how bacterioplankton communities are structured in time and space, relatively little is known about intraspecies diversity patterns and their ecological relevance. Here, we use the newly developed software POGENOM (POpulation GENomics from Metagenomes) to investigate genomic diversity and differentiation in metagenome-assembled genomes from the Baltic Sea, and investigate their genomic variation using metagenome data spanning a 1700 km transect and covering seasonal variation at one station. The majority of the investigated species, representing several major bacterioplankton clades, displayed population structures correlating significantly with environmental factors such as salinity and temperature. Population differentiation was more pronounced over spatial than temporal scales. We discovered genes that have undergone adaptation to different salinity regimes, potentially responsible for the populations' existence along with the salinity range. This in turn implies the broad existence of ecotypes that may remain undetected by rRNA gene sequencing. Our findings emphasize the importance of physiological barriers, and highlight the role of adaptive divergence as a structuring mechanism of bacterioplankton species.",
