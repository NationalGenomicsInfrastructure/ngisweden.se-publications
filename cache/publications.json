    "title": "β-thymosins and hemocyte homeostasis in a crustacean.",
    "abstract": "Thymosin proteins are well known for their actin-binding activity. Thymosin beta 4 (Tβ4) has been associated with biological activities in tissue repair and cell migration via interaction with ATP-synthase in vertebrates, while the information of similar thymosin functions in invertebrates is limited. We have shown previously that ATP-synthase is present on the surface of crayfish hematopoietic tissue (HPT) cells, and that astakine 1 (Ast1, an invertebrate cytokine) was found to interact with this β-subunit of ATP synthase. Here, we identified five different β-thymosins from Pacifastacus leniusculus, designated Pl-β-thymosin1-5. The two dominant isoforms in brain, HPT and hemocytes, Pl-β-thymosin1 and 2, were chosen for functional studies. Both isoforms could bind to the β-subunit of ATP-synthase, and Pl-β-thymosin1, but not Pl-β-thymosin2, significantly increased extracellular ATP formation. Moreover, Pl-β-thymosin1 stimulated HPT cell migration in vitro and Ast1 blocked this effect. Pl-β-thymosin2 increased the circulating hemocyte number at an early stage after injection. Additionally, in vivo injection of Pl-β-thymosin1 resulted in significant reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in crayfish HPT whereas Pl-β-thymosin2 had a similar but transient effect. Both Pl-β-thymosins induced the expression of Ast1 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) transcripts, while silencing of endogenous Pl-β-thymosin 1 and 2 by RNAi resulted in significant reduction of the Ast1 and SOD transcripts. The diverse effects exhibited by Pl-β-thymosin1 and Pl-β-thymosin2 indicates that these proteins are involved in a complex interaction that regulates the hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation.",

    "title": "Diplodia Tip Blight on Its Way to the North: Drivers of Disease Emergence in Northern Europe.",
    "abstract": "Disease emergence in northern and boreal forests has been mostly due to tree-pathogen encounters lacking a co-evolutionary past. However, outbreaks involving novel interactions of the host or the pathogen with the environment have been less well documented. Following an increase of records in Northern Europe, the first large outbreak of Diplodia sapinea on Pinus sylvestris was discovered in Sweden in 2016. By reconstructing the development of the epidemic, we found that the attacks started approx. 10 years back from several isolated trees in the stand and ended up affecting almost 90% of the trees in 2016. Limited damage was observed in other plantations in the surroundings of the affected stand, pointing to a new introduced pathogen as the cause of the outbreak. Nevertheless, no genetic differences based on SSR markers were found between isolates of the outbreak area and other Swedish isolates predating the outbreak or from other populations in Europe and Asia Minor. On a temporal scale, we saw that warm May and June temperatures were associated with higher damage and low tree growth, while cold and rainy conditions seemed to favor growth and deter disease. At a spatial scale, we saw that spread occurred predominantly in the SW aspect-area of the stand. Within that area and based on tree-ring and isotope (δ13C) analyses, we saw that disease occurred on trees that over the years had shown a lower water-use efficiency (WUE). Spore traps showed that highly infected trees were those producing the largest amount of inoculum. D. sapinea impaired latewood growth and reduced C reserves in needles and branches. D. sapinea attacks can cause serious economic damage by killing new shoots, disrupting the crown, and affecting the quality of stems. Our results show that D. sapinea has no limitations in becoming a serious pathogen in Northern Europe. Management should focus on reducing inoculum, especially since climate change may bring more favorable conditions for this pathogen. Seedlings for planting should be carefully inspected as D. sapinea may be present in a latent stage in asymptomatic tissues.",

    "abstract": "Rhodotorula toruloides is an oleaginous yeast with high biotechnological potential. In order to understand the molecular physiology of lipid synthesis in R. toruloides and to advance metabolic engineering, a high-resolution genome is required. We constructed a genome draft of R. toruloides CBS 14, using a hybrid assembly approach, consisting of short and long reads generated by Illumina and Nanopore sequencing, respectively. The genome draft consists of 23 contigs and 3 scaffolds, with a N50 length of 1,529,952 bp, thus largely representing chromosomal organization. The total size of the genome is 20,534,857 bp and the overall GC content is 61.83%. Transcriptomic data from different growth conditions was used to aid species-specific gene annotation. We annotated 9464 genes and identified 11,691 transcripts. Furthermore, we demonstrated the presence of a potential plasmid, an extrachromosomal circular structure of about 11 kb with a copy number about three times as high as the other chromosomes.",

    "title": "Single-cell RNA-seq mapping of chicken peripheral blood leukocytes.",
    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics provides means to study cell populations at the level of individual cells. In leukocyte biology this approach could potentially aid the identification of subpopulations and functions without the need to develop species-specific reagents. The present study aimed to evaluate single-cell RNA-seq as a tool for identification of chicken peripheral blood leukocytes. For this purpose, purified and thrombocyte depleted leukocytes from 4 clinically healthy hens were subjected to single-cell 3' RNA-seq. Bioinformatic analysis of data comprised unsupervised clustering of the cells, and annotation of clusters based on expression profiles. Immunofluorescence phenotyping of the cell preparations used was also performed.\n\nComputational analysis identified 31 initial cell clusters and based on expression of defined marker genes 28 cluster were identified as comprising mainly B-cells, T-cells, monocytes, thrombocytes and red blood cells. Of the remaining clusters, two were putatively identified as basophils and eosinophils, and one as proliferating cells of mixed origin. In depth analysis on gene expression profiles within and between the initial cell clusters allowed further identification of cell identity and possible functions for some of them. For example, analysis of the group of monocyte clusters revealed subclusters comprising heterophils, as well as putative monocyte subtypes. Also, novel aspects of TCRγ/δ + T-cell subpopulations could be inferred such as evidence of at least two subtypes based on e.g., different expression of transcription factors MAF, SOX13 and GATA3. Moreover, a novel subpopulation of chicken peripheral B-cells with high SOX5 expression was identified. An overall good correlation between mRNA and cell surface phenotypic cell identification was shown.\n\nTaken together, we were able to identify and infer functional aspects of both previously well known as well as novel chicken leukocyte populations although some cell types. e.g., T-cell subtypes, proved more challenging to decipher. Although this methodology to some extent is limited by incomplete annotation of the chicken genome, it definitively has benefits in chicken immunology by expanding the options to distinguish identity and functions of immune cells also without access to species specific reagents.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal environmental variation is a leading driver of microbial planktonic community assembly and interactions. However, departures from usual seasonal trends are often reported. To understand the role of local stressors in modifying seasonal succession, we sampled fortnightly, throughout three seasons, five nearby shallow soda lakes exposed to identical seasonal and meteorological changes. We characterised their microeukaryotic and bacterial communities by amplicon sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA gene, respectively. Biological interactions were inferred by analyses of synchronous and time-shifted interaction networks, and the keystone taxa of the communities were topologically identified. The lakes showed similar succession patterns during the study period with spring being characterised by the relevance of trophic interactions and a certain level of community stability followed by a more dynamic and variable summer-autumn period. Adaptation to general seasonal changes happened through shared core microbiome of the lakes. Stochastic events such as desiccation disrupted common network attributes and introduced shifts from the prevalent seasonal trajectory. Our results demonstrated that, despite being extreme and highly variable habitats, shallow soda lakes exhibit certain similarities in the seasonality of their planktonic communities, yet local stressors such as droughts instigate deviations from prevalent trends to a greater extent for microeukaryotic than for bacterial communities.",

    "title": "A pan-genomic approach reveals novel Sulfurimonas clade in the ferruginous meromictic Lake Pavin.",
    "abstract": "The permanently anoxic waters in meromictic lakes create suitable niches for the growth of bacteria using sulphur metabolisms like sulphur oxidation. In Lake Pavin, the anoxic water mass hosts an active cryptic sulphur cycle that interacts narrowly with iron cycling, however the metabolisms of the microorganisms involved are poorly known. Here we combined metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and pan-genomics to further expand our understanding of the bacteria and the corresponding metabolisms involved in sulphur oxidation in this ferruginous sulphide- and sulphate-poor meromictic lake. We highlighted two new species within the genus Sulfurimonas that belong to a novel clade of chemotrophic sulphur oxidisers exclusive to freshwaters. We moreover conclude that this genus holds a key-role not only in limiting sulphide accumulation in the upper part of the anoxic layer but also constraining carbon, phosphate and iron cycling.",

    "title": "A survey of ficolin-3 activity in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus reveals a link to hematological disease manifestations and autoantibody profile.",
    "abstract": "The complement system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), but most studies have focused on the classical pathway. Ficolin-3 is the main initiator of the lectin pathway of complement in humans, but its role in systemic autoimmune disease has not been conclusively determined. Here, we combined biochemical and genetic approaches to assess the contribution of ficolin-3 to SLE risk and disease manifestations. Ficolin-3 activity was measured by a functional assay in serum or plasma samples from Swedish SLE patients (n = 786) and controls matched for age and sex (n = 566). Genetic variants in an extended 300 kb genomic region spanning the FCN3 locus were analyzed for their association with ficolin-3 activity and SLE manifestations in a Swedish multicenter cohort (n = 985). Patients with ficolin-3 activity in the highest tertile showed a strong enrichment in an SLE cluster defined by anti-Sm/DNA/nucleosome antibodies (OR 3.0, p < 0.001) and had increased rates of hematological disease (OR 1.4, p = 0.078) and lymphopenia (OR = 1.6, p = 0.039). Genetic variants associated with low ficolin-3 activity mapped to an extended haplotype in high linkage disequilibrium upstream of the FCN3 gene. Patients carrying the lead genetic variant associated with low ficolin-3 activity had a lower frequency of hematological disease (OR 0.67, p = 0.018) and lymphopenia (OR 0.63, p = 0.031) and fewer autoantibodies (p = 0.0019). Loss-of-function variants in the FCN3 gene were not associated with SLE, but four (0.5 %) SLE patients developed acquired ficolin-3 deficiency where ficolin-3 activity in serum was depleted following diagnosis of SLE. Taken together, our results provide genetic and biochemical evidence that implicate the lectin pathway in hematological SLE manifestations. We also identify lectin pathway activation through ficolin-3 as a factor that contributes to the autoantibody response in SLE.",

    "abstract": "Recombination reshuffles alleles at linked loci, allowing genes to evolve independently and consequently enhancing the efficiency of selection. This makes quantifying recombination along chromosomes an important goal for understanding how selection and drift are acting on genes and chromosomes.\n\nWe present RecView, an interactive R application and its homonymous R package, to facilitate locating recombination positions along chromosomes or scaffolds using whole-genome genotype data of a three-generation pedigree. RecView analyses and plots the grandparent-of-origin of all informative alleles along each chromosome of the offspring in the pedigree, and infers recombination positions with either of two built-in algorithms: one based on change in the proportion of the alleles with specific grandparent-of-origin, and one on the degree of continuity of alleles with the same grandparent-of-origin. RecView handles multiple offspring and chromosomes simultaneously, and all putative recombination positions are reported in base pairs together with an estimated precision based on the local density of informative alleles. We demonstrate RecView using genotype data of a passerine bird with an available reference genome, the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), and show that recombination events can be located to specific positions.\n\nRecView is an easy-to-use and highly effective application for locating recombination positions with high precision.

    "title": "Bacterial bioindicators enable biological status classification along the continental Danube river.",
    "abstract": "Despite the importance of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems and their predictable diversity patterns across space and time, biomonitoring tools for status assessment relying on these organisms are widely lacking. This is partly due to insufficient data and models to identify reliable microbial predictors. Here, we show metabarcoding in combination with multivariate statistics and machine learning allows to identify bacterial bioindicators for existing biological status classification systems. Bacterial beta-diversity dynamics follow environmental gradients and the observed associations highlight potential bioindicators for ecological outcomes. Spatio-temporal links spanning the microbial communities along the river allow accurate prediction of downstream biological status from upstream information. Network analysis on amplicon sequence veariants identify as good indicators genera Fluviicola, Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium, and Rhodoluna, and reveal informational redundancy among taxa, which coincides with taxonomic relatedness. The redundancy among bacterial bioindicators reveals mutually exclusive taxa, which allow accurate biological status modeling using as few as 2-3 amplicon sequence variants. As such our models show that using a few bacterial amplicon sequence variants from globally distributed genera allows for biological status assessment along river systems.",

    "title": "A pyrosequencing study in twins shows that gastrointestinal microbial profiles vary with inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.",
    "abstract": "The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is thought to have an important role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Interindividual variation and an inability to detect less abundant bacteria have made it difficult to correlate specific bacteria with disease.\n\nWe used 454 pyrotag sequencing to determine the compositions of microbial communities in feces samples collected from a cohort of 40 twin pairs who were concordant or discordant for CD or UC, and in mucosal samples from a subset of the cohort. The cohort primarily comprised patients who were in remission, but also some with active disease.\n\nThe profiles of the microbial community differed with disease phenotypes; relative amounts of bacterial populations correlated with IBD phenotypes. The microbial compositions of individuals with CD differed from those of healthy individuals, but were similar between healthy individuals and individuals with UC. Profiles from individuals with CD that predominantly involved the ileum differed from those with CD that predominantly involved the colon; several bacterial populations increased or decreased with disease type. Changes specific to patients with ileal CD included the disappearance of core bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and increased amounts of Enterobacteriaceae and Ruminococcus gnavus.\n\nBacterial populations differ in abundance among individuals with different phenotypes of CD. Specific species of bacteria are associated with ileal CD; further studies should investigate their role in pathogenesis.",

    "title": "High risk of tobacco-related cancers in CDKN2A mutation-positive melanoma families.",
    "abstract": "Germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDKN2A occur in 5-20% of familial melanoma cases. A single founder mutation, p.Arg112dup, accounts for the majority of CDKN2A mutations in Swedish carriers. In a national program, carriers of p.Arg112dup mutation have been identified. The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in p.Arg112dup carriers and their first degree relatives (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRs).\n\nIn this prospective cohort study, cancer diagnoses in carriers (n=120), non-carriers (n=111), carriers' FDRs (n=275) and SDRs (n=321) and controls (n=3976) were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Relative risks (RRs) for cancers were calculated (number of cancers/person years). Two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for all RRs.\n\nIn carriers prospective RR for non-melanoma cancers was 5.0 (95% CI 3.7 to 7.3), for pancreatic cancer 43.8 (95% CI 13.8 to 139.0), for cancers in upper digestive tissues 17.1 (95% CI 6.3 to 46.5), and in respiratory tissues 15.6 (5.4 to 46.0). In FDRs and SDRs RRs were significantly elevated for cancers in pancreas, respiratory and upper digestive tissues. In ever-smoking carriers compared with never-smoking carriers, the odds ratio (OR) of cancers in pancreas, respiratory or upper digestive tissues was 9.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 44.7).\n\nCDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers from melanoma-prone families and their FDRs and SDRs have elevated risk for pancreatic, lung, head and neck and gastro-oesophageal carcinomas. These cancers were mainly seen in ever-smoking carriers. Germline CDKN2A mutations may confer an increased sensitivity to carcinogens in tobacco smoke. CDKN2A mutation carriers should be counselled to abstain from smoking.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of functional dispersal barriers in the marine environment can be used to inform a wide variety of management actions, such as marine spatial planning, restoration efforts, fisheries regulations, and invasive species management. Locations and causes of dispersal barriers can be studied through various methods, including movement tracking, biophysical modeling, demographic models, and genetics. Combining methods illustrating potential dispersal, such as biophysical modeling, with realized dispersal through, e.g., genetic connectivity estimates, provides particularly useful information for teasing apart potential causes of observed barriers. In this study, we focus on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Skagerrak-a marginal sea connected to the North Sea in Northern Europe-and combine biophysical models of larval dispersal with genomic data to infer locations and causes of dispersal barriers in the area. Results from both methods agree; patterns of ocean currents are a major structuring factor in the area. We find a complex pattern of source-sink dynamics with several dispersal barriers and show that some areas can be isolated despite an overall high dispersal capability. Finally, we translate our finding into management advice that can be used to sustainably manage this ecologically and economically important species in the future.",

REH is one of the most frequently used cell lines for functional studies of pediatric ALL, and these data provide a multi-faceted characterization of its molecular features. The datasets described herein, generated with short- and long-read sequencing technologies, can both provide insights into the complex aberrant karyotype of REH, and be used as reference datasets for sequencing data quality assessment or for methods development.\r\n\r\nThis paper describes 33 datasets corresponding to 867 gigabases of raw sequencing data generated from the REH cell line. These datasets include five different approaches for whole genome sequencing (WGS) on four sequencing platforms, two RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques on two different sequencing platforms, DNA methylation sequencing, and single-cell ATAC-sequencing.",

    "title": "High-throughput single-cell sequencing identifies photoheterotrophs and chemoautotrophs in freshwater bacterioplankton.",
    "abstract": "Recent discoveries suggest that photoheterotrophs (rhodopsin-containing bacteria (RBs) and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAPs)) and chemoautotrophs may be significant for marine and freshwater ecosystem productivity. However, their abundance and taxonomic identities remain largely unknown. We used a combination of single-cell and metagenomic DNA sequencing to study the predominant photoheterotrophs and chemoautotrophs inhabiting the euphotic zone of temperate, physicochemically diverse freshwater lakes. Multi-locus sequencing of 712 single amplified genomes, generated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and whole genome multiple displacement amplification, showed that most of the cosmopolitan freshwater clusters contain photoheterotrophs. These comprised at least 10-23% of bacterioplankton, and RBs were the dominant fraction. Our data demonstrate that Actinobacteria, including clusters acI, Luna and acSTL, are the predominant freshwater RBs. We significantly broaden the known taxonomic range of freshwater RBs, to include Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Sphingobacteria. By sequencing single cells, we found evidence for inter-phyla horizontal gene transfer and recombination of rhodopsin genes and identified specific taxonomic groups involved in these evolutionary processes. Our data suggest that members of the ubiquitous betaproteobacteria Polynucleobacter spp. are the dominant AAPs in temperate freshwater lakes. Furthermore, the RuBisCO (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) gene was found in several single cells of Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting that chemoautotrophs may be more prevalent among aerobic bacterioplankton than previously thought. This study demonstrates the power of single-cell DNA sequencing addressing previously unresolved questions about the metabolic potential and evolutionary histories of uncultured microorganisms, which dominate most natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is associated with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases in men, and genetic predisposition to LOY is associated with poor poststroke outcome. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that LOY itself is associated with functional outcome after ischemic stroke.\n\nThe study comprised male patients with ischemic stroke from the cohort studies SAHLSIS2 (Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke Phase 2; n=588) and LSR (Lund Stroke Register; n=735). We used binary logistic regression to analyze associations between LOY, determined by DNA microarray intensity data, and poor 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, >2) in each cohort separately and combined. Patients who received recanalization therapy were excluded from sensitivity analyses.\n\nLOY was associated with about 2.5-fold increased risk of poor outcome in univariable analyses (P<0.001). This association withstood separate adjustment for stroke severity and diabetes in both cohorts but not age. In sensitivity analyses restricted to the nonrecanalization group (n=987 in the combined cohort), the association was significant also after separate adjustment for age (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.4]) and when additionally adjusting for stroke severity and diabetes (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.5]).\n\nWe observed an association between LOY and poor outcome after ischemic stroke in patients not receiving recanalization therapy. Future studies on LOY and other somatic genetic alterations in larger stroke cohorts are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium botulinum strains can be divided into four physiological groups that are sufficiently diverged to be considered as separate species. Here we present the first complete genome of a C. botulinum strain from physiological group III, causing animal botulism. We also compare the sequence to three new draft genomes from the same physiological group.\n\nThe 2.77 Mb chromosome was highly conserved between the isolates and also closely related to that of C. novyi. However, the sequence was very different from the human C. botulinum group genomes. Replication-directed translocations were rare and conservation of synteny was high. The largest difference between C. botulinum group III isolates occurred within their surprisingly large plasmidomes and in the pattern of mobile elements insertions. Five plasmids, constituting 13.5% of the total genetic material, were present in the completed genome. Interestingly, the set of plasmids differed compared to other isolates. The largest plasmid, the botulinum-neurotoxin carrying prophage, was conserved at a level similar to that of the chromosome while the medium-sized plasmids seemed to be undergoing faster genetic drift. These plasmids also contained more mobile elements than other replicons. Several toxins and resistance genes were identified, many of which were located on the plasmids.\n\nThe completion of the genome of C. botulinum group III has revealed it to be a genome with dual identity. It belongs to the pathogenic species C. botulinum, but as a genotypic species it should also include C. novyi and C. haemolyticum. The genotypic species share a conserved chromosomal core that can be transformed into various pathogenic variants by modulation of the highly plastic plasmidome.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker identification is of utmost importance for the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. Here we make use of a translational database selection strategy, utilizing data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) on differentially expressed protein patterns in healthy and breast cancer tissues as a means to filter out potential biomarkers for underlying genetic causatives of the disease. DNA was isolated from ten breast cancer biopsies, and the protein coding and flanking non-coding genomic regions corresponding to the selected proteins were extracted in a multiplexed format from the samples using a single DNA sequence capture array. Deep sequencing revealed an even enrichment of the multiplexed samples and a great variation of genetic alterations in the tumors of the sampled individuals. Benefiting from the upstream filtering method, the final set of biomarker candidates could be completely verified through bidirectional Sanger sequencing, revealing a 40 percent false positive rate despite high read coverage. Of the variants encountered in translated regions, nine novel non-synonymous variations were identified and verified, two of which were present in more than one of the ten tumor samples.",

    "title": "Recurrent EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusions in sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma.",
    "abstract": "Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) are 2 distinct types of sarcoma, with a subset of cases showing overlapping morphologic and immunohistochemical features. LGFMS is characterized by expression of the MUC4 protein, and about 90% of cases display a distinctive FUS-CREB3L2 gene fusion. In addition, SEF is often MUC4 positive, but is genetically less well studied. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies have shown involvement of the FUS gene in the majority of so-called hybrid LGFMS/SEF and in 10% to 25% of sarcomas with pure SEF morphology. In this study, we investigated a series of 10 primary tumors showing pure SEF morphology, 4 cases of LGFMS that at local or distant relapse showed predominant SEF morphology, and 1 primary hybrid LGFMS/SEF. All but 1 case showed diffuse expression for MUC4. Using FISH, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and/or mRNA sequencing in selected cases, we found recurrent EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion transcripts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 3/10 pure SEF cases and splits and deletions of the EWSR1 and/or CREB3L1 genes by FISH in 6 additional cases. All 5 cases of LGFMS with progression to SEF morphology or hybrid features had FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts. Our results indicate that EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, highlighting that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types, with different impacts on patient outcome.",

    "title": "Integrative transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the effects of cell confluency on gene expression.",
    "abstract": "In this study we examine the impact of cell confluency on gene expression. We focused on Argonaute (AGO) protein dynamics and associated gene and protein expression in HEK293, A375, and SHSY5Y cell lines. As a consequence of cell confluency, AGO2 protein translocates into the nucleus. Therefore, we generated transcriptomic data using RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in subconfluent versus confluent cells, which highlighted significant alterations in gene regulation patterns directly corresponding to changes in cell density. Our study also encompasses miRNA profiling data obtained through small RNA sequencing, revealing miRNA expressional changes dependent on cellular confluency, as well as cellular localization. Finally, we derived proteomic data from mass spectrometry analyses following AGO1-4 immunoprecipitation, providing a comprehensive view of AGO interactome in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments under varying confluency. These datasets offer a detailed exploration of the cellular and molecular dynamics, influenced by cell confluency, presenting a valuable resource for further research in cellular biology, particularly in understanding the basic mechanisms of cell density in cancer cells.",
