    "title": "Restricted X chromosome introgression and support for Haldane's rule in hybridizing damselflies.",
    "abstract": "Contemporary hybrid zones act as natural laboratories for the investigation of species boundaries and may shed light on the little understood roles of sex chromosomes in species divergence. Sex chromosomes are considered to function as a hotspot of genetic divergence between species; indicated by less genomic introgression compared to autosomes during hybridization. Moreover, they are thought to contribute to Haldane's rule, which states that hybrids of the heterogametic sex are more likely to be inviable or sterile. To test these hypotheses, we used contemporary hybrid zones of Ischnura elegans, a damselfly species that has been expanding its range into the northern and western regions of Spain, leading to chronic hybridization with its sister species Ischnura graellsii. We analysed genome-wide SNPs in the Spanish I. elegans and I. graellsii hybrid zone and found (i) that the X chromosome shows less genomic introgression compared to autosomes, and (ii) that males are underrepresented among admixed individuals, as predicted by Haldane's rule. This is the first study in Odonata that suggests a role of the X chromosome in reproductive isolation. Moreover, our data add to the few studies on species with X0 sex determination system and contradict the hypothesis that the absence of a Y chromosome causes exceptions to Haldane's rule.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of proteins circulate in the bloodstream; identifying those which associate with weight and intervention-induced weight loss may help explain mechanisms of diseases associated with adiposity. We aimed to identify consistent protein signatures of weight loss across independent studies capturing changes in body mass index (BMI). We analysed proteomic data from studies implementing caloric restriction (Diabetes Remission Clinical trial) and bariatric surgery (By-Band-Sleeve), using SomaLogic and Olink Explore1536 technologies, respectively. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of the interventions on circulating proteins. Twenty-three proteins were altered in a consistent direction after both bariatric surgery and caloric restriction, suggesting that these proteins are modulated by weight change, independent of intervention type. We also integrated Mendelian randomisation (MR) estimates of the effect of BMI on proteins measured by SomaLogic from a UK blood donor cohort as a third line of causal evidence. These MR estimates provided further corroborative evidence for a role of BMI in regulating the levels of six proteins including alcohol dehydrogenase-4, nogo receptor and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein. These results indicate the importance of triangulation in interrogating causal relationships; further study into the role of proteins modulated by weight in disease is now warranted.",

    "title": "Genome-wide transcriptional and physiological responses to drought stress in leaves and roots of two willow genotypes.",
    "abstract": "Drought is a major environmental stress that can have severe impacts on plant productivity and survival. Understanding molecular mechanisms of drought responses is crucial in order to breed for drought adapted plant cultivars. The aim of the present study was to investigate phenotypic and transcriptional drought responses in two willow genotypes (520 and 592) originating from an experimental cross between S. viminalis × (S. viminalis × S. schwerinii). Willows are woody perennials in the Salicaceae plant family that are grown as bioenergy crops worldwide.\n\nAn experiment was conducted where plants were exposed to drought and different eco-physiological parameters were assessed. RNA-seq data was furthermore generated with the Illumina technology from root tips and leaves from plants grown in drought and well-watered (WW) conditions. The RNA-seq data was assembled de novo with the Trinity assembler to create a reference gene set to which the reads were mapped in order to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the drought and WW conditions. To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in the drought response, GO enrichment analyses were conducted. Candidate genes with a putative function in the drought response were also identified.\n\nA total of 52,599 gene models were obtained and after filtering on gene expression (FPKM ≥ 1), 35,733 gene models remained, of which 24,421 contained open reading frames. A total of 5,112 unique DEGs were identified between drought and WW conditions, of which the majority were found in the root tips. Phenotypically, genotype 592 displayed less growth reduction in response to drought compared to genotype 520. At the transcriptional level, genotype 520 displayed a greater response in the leaves as more DEGs were found in genotype 520 compared to genotype 592. In contrast, the transcriptional responses in the root tips were rather similar between the two genotypes. A core set of candidate genes encoding proteins with a putative function in drought response was identified, for example MYBs and bZIPs as well as chlorophyll a/b binding proteins.\n\nWe found substantial differences in drought responses between the genotypes, both at the phenotypic and transcriptional levels. In addition to the genotypic variation in several traits, we also found indications for genotypic variation in trait plasticity, which could play a role in drought adaptation. Furthermore, the two genotypes displayed overall similar transcriptional responses in the root tips, but more variation in the leaves. It is thus possible that the observed phenotypic differences could be a result of transcriptional differences mostly at the leaf level.\n\nThis study has contributed to a better general understanding of drought responses in woody plants, specifically in willows, and has implications for breeding research towards more drought adapted plants.",

    "title": "Genome wide association study identifies KCNMA1 contributing to human obesity.",
    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide association (GWA) analyses have identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with obesity. However, the reported genetic variation in obesity explains only a minor fraction of the total genetic variation expected to be present in the population. Thus many genetic variants controlling obesity remain to be identified. The aim of this study was to use GWA followed by multiple stepwise validations to identify additional genes associated with obesity.\n\nWe performed a GWA analysis in 164 morbidly obese subjects (BMI:body mass index>40 kg/m2) and 163 Swedish subjects (>45 years) who had always been lean. The 700 SNPs displaying the strongest association with obesity in the GWA were analyzed in a second cohort comprising 460 morbidly obese subjects and 247 consistently lean Swedish adults. 23 SNPs remained significantly associated with obesity (nominal P<0.05) and were in a step-wise manner followed up in five additional cohorts from Sweden, France, and Germany together comprising 4214 obese and 5417 lean or population-based control individuals. Three samples, n=4133, were used to investigate the population-based associations with BMI. Gene expression in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue in relation to obesity was investigated for14 adults.\n\nPotassium channel, calcium activated, large conductance, subfamily M, alpha member (KCNMA1) rs2116830*G and BDNF rs988712*G were associated with obesity in five of six investigated case-control cohorts. In meta-analysis of 4838 obese and 5827 control subjects we obtained genome-wide significant allelic association with obesity for KCNMA1 rs2116830*G with P=2.82×10(-10) and an odds ratio (OR) based on cases vs controls of 1.26 [95% C.I. 1.12-1.41] and for BDNF rs988712*G with P=5.2×10(-17) and an OR of 1.36 [95% C.I. 1.20-1.55]. KCNMA1 rs2116830*G was not associated with BMI in the population-based samples. Adipose tissue (P=0.0001) and fat cell (P=0.04) expression of KCNMA1 was increased in obesity.\n\nWe have identified KCNMA1 as a new susceptibility locus for obesity, and confirmed the association of the BDNF locus at the genome-wide significant level.",

    "title": "The relative contribution of DNA methylation and genetic variants on protein biomarkers for human diseases.",
    "abstract": "Associations between epigenetic alterations and disease status have been identified for many diseases. However, there is no strong evidence that epigenetic alterations are directly causal for disease pathogenesis. In this study, we combined SNP and DNA methylation data with measurements of protein biomarkers for cancer, inflammation or cardiovascular disease, to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation on biomarker levels. A total of 121 protein biomarkers were measured and analyzed in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions and to over 10 million SNPs. We performed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses, and integrated biomarker, DNA methylation and SNP data using between 698 and 1033 samples depending on data availability for the different analyses. We identified 124 and 45 loci (Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.05) with effect sizes up to 0.22 standard units' change per 1% change in DNA methylation levels and up to four standard units' change per copy of the effective allele in the EWAS and GWAS respectively. Most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory whereas most EWAS loci were located in trans. Eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one in NLRC5 associated with CXCL11, CXCL9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels. All EWAS signals that overlapped with a GWAS locus were driven by underlying genetic variants and three EWAS signals were confounded by smoking. While some cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers appeared to have an effect also on DNA methylation levels, cis-regulatory SNPs for DNA methylation were not observed to affect biomarker levels. We present associations between protein biomarker and DNA methylation levels at numerous loci in the genome. The associations are likely to reflect the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represent secondary effects to the pathogenesis of disease.",

    "abstract": "Lipoprotein(a) concentrations in plasma are associated with cardiovascular risk in the general population. Whether lipoprotein(a) concentrations or LPA genetic variants predict long-term mortality in patients with established coronary heart disease remains less clear.\n\nWe obtained data from 3313 patients with established coronary heart disease in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study. We tested associations of tertiles of lipoprotein(a) concentration in plasma and two LPA single-nucleotide polymorphisms ([SNPs] rs10455872 and rs3798220) with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality by Cox regression analysis and with severity of disease by generalised linear modelling, with and without adjustment for age, sex, diabetes diagnosis, systolic blood pressure, BMI, smoking status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, LDL-cholesterol concentration, and use of lipid-lowering therapy. Results for plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations were validated in five independent studies involving 10 195 patients with established coronary heart disease. Results for genetic associations were replicated through large-scale collaborative analysis in the GENIUS-CHD consortium, comprising 106 353 patients with established coronary heart disease and 19 332 deaths in 22 studies or cohorts.\n\nThe median follow-up was 9·9 years. Increased severity of coronary heart disease was associated with lipoprotein(a) concentrations in plasma in the highest tertile (adjusted hazard radio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·14-1·83) and the presence of either LPA SNP (1·88, 1·40-2·53). No associations were found in LURIC with all-cause mortality (highest tertile of lipoprotein(a) concentration in plasma 0·95, 0·81-1·11 and either LPA SNP 1·10, 0·92-1·31) or cardiovascular mortality (0·99, 0·81-1·2 and 1·13, 0·90-1·40, respectively) or in the validation studies.\n\nIn patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, lipoprotein(a) concentrations and genetic variants showed no associations with mortality. We conclude that these variables are not useful risk factors to measure to predict progression to death after coronary heart disease is established.\n\nSeventh Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development (AtheroRemo and RiskyCAD), INTERREG IV Oberrhein Programme, Deutsche Nierenstiftung, Else-Kroener Fresenius Foundation, Deutsche Stiftung für Herzforschung, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Saarland University, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Willy Robert Pitzer Foundation, and Waldburg-Zeil Clinics Isny.",

    "title": "Parental epigenetic asymmetry of PRC2-mediated histone modifications in the Arabidopsis endosperm.",
    "abstract": "Parental genomes in the endosperm are marked by differential DNA methylation and are therefore epigenetically distinct. This epigenetic asymmetry is established in the gametes and maintained after fertilization by unknown mechanisms. In this manuscript, we have addressed the key question whether parentally inherited differential DNA methylation affects de novo targeting of chromatin modifiers in the early endosperm. Our data reveal that polycomb-mediated H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is preferentially localized to regions that are targeted by the DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME), mechanistically linking DNA hypomethylation to imprinted gene expression. Our data furthermore suggest an absence of de novo DNA methylation in the early endosperm, providing an explanation how DME-mediated hypomethylation of the maternal genome is maintained after fertilization. Lastly, we show that paternal-specific H3K27me3-marked regions are located at pericentromeric regions, suggesting that H3K27me3 and DNA methylation are not necessarily exclusive marks at pericentromeric regions in the endosperm.",

    "title": "A DNA methylation site within the KLF13 gene is associated with orexigenic processes based on neural responses and ghrelin levels.",
    "abstract": "We investigated five methylation markers recently linked to body mass index, for their role in the neuropathology of obesity. In neuroimaging experiments, our analysis involving 23 participants showed that methylation levels for the cg07814318 site, which lies within the KLF13 gene, correlated with brain activity in the claustrum, putamen, cingulate gyrus and frontal gyri, some of which have been previously associated to food signaling, obesity or reward. Methylation levels at cg07814318 also positively correlated with ghrelin levels. Moreover, expression of KLF13 was augmented in the brains of obese and starved mice. Our results suggest the cg07814318 site could be involved in orexigenic processes, and also implicate KLF13 in obesity. Our findings are the first to associate methylation levels in blood with brain activity in obesity-related regions, and further support previous findings between ghrelin, brain activity and genetic differences.",

    "title": "Demography and mating system shape the genome-wide impact of purifying selection in Arabis alpina.",
    "abstract": "Plant mating systems have profound effects on levels and structuring of genetic variation and can affect the impact of natural selection. Although theory predicts that intermediate outcrossing rates may allow plants to prevent accumulation of deleterious alleles, few studies have empirically tested this prediction using genomic data. Here, we study the effect of mating system on purifying selection by conducting population-genomic analyses on whole-genome resequencing data from 38 European individuals of the arctic-alpine crucifer Arabis alpina We find that outcrossing and mixed-mating populations maintain genetic diversity at similar levels, whereas highly self-fertilizing Scandinavian A. alpina show a strong reduction in genetic diversity, most likely as a result of a postglacial colonization bottleneck. We further find evidence for accumulation of genetic load in highly self-fertilizing populations, whereas the genome-wide impact of purifying selection does not differ greatly between mixed-mating and outcrossing populations. Our results demonstrate that intermediate levels of outcrossing may allow efficient selection against harmful alleles, whereas demographic effects can be important for relaxed purifying selection in highly selfing populations. Thus, mating system and demography shape the impact of purifying selection on genomic variation in A. alpina These results are important for an improved understanding of the evolutionary consequences of mating system variation and the maintenance of mixed-mating strategies.",

    "title": "Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies That the ABO Blood Group System Influences Interleukin-10 Levels and the Risk of Clinical Events in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of mortality worldwide. We have previously shown that increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with poor outcome in ACS patients.\n\nWe performed a genome-wide association study in 2864 ACS patients and 408 healthy controls, to identify genetic variants associated with IL-10 levels. Then haplotype analyses of the identified loci were done and comparisons to levels of IL-10 and other known ACS related biomarkers.\n\nGenetic variants at the ABO blood group locus associated with IL-10 levels (top SNP: rs676457, P = 4.4 × 10-10) were identified in the ACS patients. Haplotype analysis, using SNPs tagging the four main ABO antigens (A1, A2, B and O), showed that O and A2 homozygous individuals, or O/A2 heterozygotes have much higher levels of IL-10 compared to individuals with other antigen combinations. In the ACS patients, associations between ABO antigens and von Willebrand factor (VWF, P = 9.2 × 10-13), and soluble tissue factor (sTF, P = 8.6 × 10-4) were also found. In the healthy control cohort, the associations with VWF and sTF were similar to those in ACS patients (P = 1.2 × 10-15 and P = 1.0 × 10-5 respectively), but the healthy cohort showed no association with IL-10 levels (P>0.05). In the ACS patients, the O antigen was also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, all causes of death, and recurrent myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24-1.29, P = 0.029-0.00067).\n\nOur results suggest that the ABO antigens play important roles, not only for the immunological response in ACS patients, but also for the outcome of the disease.",

    "title": "Infants' looking preferences for social versus non-social objects reflect genetic variation.",
    "abstract": "To what extent do individual differences in infants' early preference for faces versus non-facial objects reflect genetic and environmental factors? Here in a sample of 536 5-month-old same-sex twins, we assessed attention to faces using eye tracking in two ways: initial orienting to faces at the start of the trial (thought to reflect subcortical processing) and sustained face preference throughout the trial (thought to reflect emerging attention control). Twin model fitting suggested an influence of genetic and unique environmental effects, but there was no evidence for an effect of shared environment. The heritability of face orienting and preference were 0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.33) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.57), respectively. Face preference was associated positively with later parent-reported verbal competence (β = 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.25, P = 0.014, R2 = 0.018, N = 420). This study suggests that individual differences in young infants' selection of perceptual input-social versus non-social-are heritable, providing a developmental perspective on gene-environment interplay occurring at the level of eye movements.",

    "abstract": "Autoantibodies against the adrenal enzyme 21-hydroxylase is a hallmark manifestation in autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD). Steroid 21-hydroxylase is encoded by CYP21A2, which is located in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region together with the highly similar pseudogene CYP21A1P. A high level of copy number variation is seen for the 2 genes, and therefore, we asked whether genetic variation of the CYP21 genes is associated with AAD.\r\n\r\nCase-control study on patients with AAD and healthy controls.\r\n\r\nUsing next-generation DNA sequencing, we estimated the copy number of CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P, together with HLA alleles, in 479 Swedish patients with AAD and autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase and in 1393 healthy controls.\r\n\r\nWith 95% of individuals carrying 2 functional 21-hydroxylase genes, no difference in CYP21A2 copy number was found when comparing patients and controls. In contrast, we discovered a lower copy number of the pseudogene CYP21A1P among AAD patients (P = 5 × 10-44), together with associations of additional nucleotide variants, in the CYP21 region. However, the strongest association was found for HLA-DQB1*02:01 (P = 9 × 10-63), which, in combination with the DRB1*04:04-DQB1*03:02 haplotype, imposed the greatest risk of AAD.\r\n\r\nWe identified strong associations between copy number variants in the CYP21 region and risk of AAD, although these associations most likely are due to linkage disequilibrium with disease-associated HLA class II alleles.",

    "title": "Pregnancy-related hormones and COMT genotype: Associations with maternal working memory.",
    "abstract": "Women experience different degrees of subjective cognitive changes during pregnancy. The exact mechanism underlying these changes is unknown, although endocrine alterations and genetics may be contributing factors. We investigated whether multiple pregnancy-related hormones were associated with working memory function assessed with the Digit Span Test (DST) in late pregnancy. Moreover, we examined whether the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype, previously related to working memory, was an effect modifier in this association. In this population-based panel study, we recorded psychiatric history, medication use, socio-demographic characteristics, and psychological well-being, gathered blood and saliva samples, and administered the DST at gestational weeks 35-39 (N = 216). We conducted multivariate linear regressions with DST as outcome, with different hormones and COMT genotype, adjusting for covariates including maternal age, BMI, education, depressive symptoms, and parity. We repeated these analyses excluding women with elevated depressive symptoms. Higher DST total scores were associated with increased free estradiol concentrations (B = 0.01, p = 0.03; B = 0.01, p = 0.02) in all participants and in participants without depressive symptoms, respectively, whereas DST forward was positively associated with free estradiol only in women without depressive symptoms (B = 0.01, p = 0.04). Lower total testosterone concentrations (B = -0.03, p = 0.01) enhanced DST backward performance in non-depressed women. Maternal higher education was significantly associated with the DST subscales in all participants. No significant differences emerged when considering the COMT genotype. Our results suggest differential associations of free estradiol and total testosterone levels with working memory function in late pregnancy.",

    "title": "Developmental landscape of human forebrain at a single-cell level identifies early waves of oligodendrogenesis.",
    "abstract": "Oligodendrogenesis in the human central nervous system has been observed mainly at the second trimester of gestation, a much later developmental stage compared to oligodendrogenesis in mice. Here, we characterize the transcriptomic neural diversity in the human forebrain at post-conception weeks (PCW) 8-10. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we find evidence of the emergence of a first wave of oligodendrocyte lineage cells as early as PCW 8, which we also confirm at the epigenomic level through the use of single-cell ATAC-seq. Using regulatory network inference, we predict key transcriptional events leading to the specification of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Moreover, by profiling the spatial expression of 50 key genes through the use of in situ sequencing (ISS), we identify regions in the human ventral fetal forebrain where oligodendrogenesis first occurs. Our results indicate evolutionary conservation of the first wave of oligodendrogenesis between mice and humans and describe regulatory mechanisms involved in human OPC specification.",

    "title": "Philippine Ayta possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world.",
    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence show that modern humans interbred with archaic Denisovans. Here, we report an account of shared demographic history between Australasians and Denisovans distinctively in Island Southeast Asia. Our analyses are based on ∼2.3 million genotypes from 118 ethnic groups of the Philippines, including 25 diverse self-identified Negrito populations, along with high-coverage genomes of Australopapuans and Ayta Magbukon Negritos. We show that Ayta Magbukon possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world-∼30%-40% greater than that of Australians and Papuans-consistent with an independent admixture event into Negritos from Denisovans. Together with the recently described Homo luzonensis, we suggest that there were multiple archaic species that inhabited the Philippines prior to the arrival of modern humans and that these archaic groups may have been genetically related. Altogether, our findings unveil a complex intertwined history of modern and archaic humans in the Asia-Pacific region, where distinct Islander Denisovan populations differentially admixed with incoming Australasians across multiple locations and at various points in time.",

    "title": "Niche partitioning between planktivorous fish in the pelagic Baltic Sea assessed by DNA metabarcoding, qPCR and microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Marine communities undergo rapid changes related to human-induced ecosystem pressures. The Baltic Sea pelagic food web has experienced several regime shifts during the past century, resulting in a system where competition between the dominant planktivorous mesopredatory clupeid fish species herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and the rapidly increasing stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) population is assumed to be high. Here, we investigate diet overlap between these three planktivorous fishes in the Baltic Sea, utilizing DNA metabarcoding on the 18S rRNA gene and the COI gene, targeted qPCR, and microscopy. Our results show niche differentiation between clupeids and stickleback, and highlight that rotifers play an important role in this pattern, as a resource that is not being used by the clupeids nor by other zooplankton in spring. We further show that all the diet assessment methods used in this study are consistent, but also that DNA metabarcoding describes the plankton-fish link at the highest taxonomic resolution. This study suggests that rotifers and other understudied soft-bodied prey may have an important function in the pelagic food web and that the growing population of pelagic stickleback may be supported by the open feeding niche offered by the rotifers.",

    "title": "Immobilization of sulfate and thiosulfate-reducing biomass on sand under haloalkaline conditions.",
    "abstract": "Biological sulfate and thiosulfate reduction under haloalkaline conditions can be applied to treat waste streams from biodesulfurization systems. However, the lack of microbial aggregation under haloalkaline conditions limits the volumetric rates of sulfate and thiosulfate reducing bioreactors. As biomass retention in haloalkaline bioreactors has not been studied before, sand was chosen as a biomass carrier material to increase cell retention and consequently raise the volumetric rates. The results showed that ~10 fold higher biomass concentrations could be achieved with sand, compared to previous studies without carrier addition. The volumetric rates of sulfate/thiosulfate reduction increased approximately 4.5 times. Biomass attachment to the sand was restricted to cavities within the sand particles. Acetate produced by acetogenic bacteria from H2 and CO2 was used as carbon source for biomass growth, while formate that was also produced from H2 and CO2 enhanced sulfate reduction. The microbial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and Tindallia related bacteria were probably responsible for formate formation from hydrogen. The community attached to the sand particles was similar to the suspended fraction, but the relative abundance of sequences most closely related to Desulfohalobiaceae was much higher in the attached fraction compared to the suspended fraction (30% and 13%, respectively). The results indicated that even though the biomass attachment to sand was poor, it still increased the biomass concentration and consequently the sulfate and thiosulfate reduction volumetric rates.",

    "title": "Airway MMP-12 and DNA methylation in COPD: an integrative approach.",
    "abstract": "In COPD, the balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their natural inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)] is shifted towards excessive degradation, reflected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as increased MMP concentrations. Because of their critical role in lung homeostasis, MMP activity is tightly regulated, but to what extent this regulation occurs through epigenetic mechanisms remains unknown.\n\nTo explore the interplay between MMPs, TIMPs, and DNA methylation (DNAm) we (1) analysed MMP-9, -12, and TIMP-1 concentrations in BAL fluid, and profiled DNAm in BAL cells from 18 COPD and 30 control subjects, (2) estimated protein-COPD relationships using multivariable regression, (3) identified protein quantitative trait methylation loci (pQTMs) with COPD as a potential modifier in a separate interaction model, and (4) integrated significant interactions with a previous COPD GWAS meta-analysis.\n\nCOPD was associated with higher levels of BAL MMP-12 (p = 0.016) but not with MMP-9 or TIMP-1. Further examination of MMP-12 identified association with DNAm at 34 loci (pQTMs), with TGFBR2 (p = 2.25 × 10-10) and THBS4 (p = 1.11 × 10-9) among the top ten pQTM genes. The interaction model identified 66 sites where the DNAm-MMP-12 association was significantly different in COPD compared to controls. Of these, one was colocalized with SNPs previously associated with COPD.\n\nOur findings indicate that airway MMP-12 may partially be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms and that this regulation is disrupted in COPD. Furthermore, integration with COPD GWAS data suggests that this dysregulation is influenced by a combination of environmental factors, disease processes, and genetics, with the latter potentially playing a lesser role.",

    "title": "Adiposity as a cause of cardiovascular disease: a Mendelian randomization study.",
    "abstract": "Adiposity, as indicated by body mass index (BMI), has been associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases in epidemiological studies. We aimed to investigate if these associations are causal, using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods.\n\nThe associations of BMI with cardiovascular outcomes [coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure and ischaemic stroke], and associations of a genetic score (32 BMI single nucleotide polymorphisms) with BMI and cardiovascular outcomes were examined in up to 22,193 individuals with 3062 incident cardiovascular events from nine prospective follow-up studies within the ENGAGE consortium. We used random-effects meta-analysis in an MR framework to provide causal estimates of the effect of adiposity on cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThere was a strong association between BMI and incident CHD (HR = 1.20 per SD-increase of BMI, 95% CI, 1.12-1.28, P = 1.9.10(-7)), heart failure (HR = 1.47, 95% CI, 1.35-1.60, P = 9.10(-19)) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.15, 95% CI, 1.06-1.24, P = 0.0008) in observational analyses. The genetic score was robustly associated with BMI (β = 0.030 SD-increase of BMI per additional allele, 95% CI, 0.028-0.033, P = 3.10(-107)). Analyses indicated a causal effect of adiposity on development of heart failure (HR = 1.93 per SD-increase of BMI, 95% CI, 1.12-3.30, P = 0.017) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.05-3.20, P = 0.034). Additional cross-sectional analyses using both ENGAGE and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data showed a causal effect of adiposity on CHD.\n\nUsing MR methods, we provide support for the hypothesis that adiposity causes CHD, heart failure and, previously not demonstrated, ischaemic stroke.",

    "title": "Uterine fluid microRNAs are dysregulated in women with recurrent implantation failure.",
    "abstract": "Is the composition of microRNAs (miRNAs) in uterine fluid (UF) of women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) different from that of healthy fertile women?\r\n\r\nThe composition of miRNAs in UF of women with RIF is different from that of healthy fertile women and the dysregulated miRNAs are associated with impaired endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation.\r\n\r\nIt has previously been demonstrated that the miRNAs secreted from endometrial cells into the UF contribute to the achievement of endometrial receptivity. Endometrial miRNAs are dysregulated in women with RIF.\r\n\r\nIn this descriptive laboratory case-control study, miRNA abundancy was compared between UF collected during implantation phase from healthy fertile women (n = 17) and women with RIF (n = 34), which was defined as three failed IVF cycles with high-quality embryos.\r\n\r\nRecruitment of study subjects and sampling of UF were performed at two university clinics in Stockholm, Sweden and Tartu, Estonia. The study participants monitored their menstrual cycles using an LH test kit. The UF samples were collected on Day LH + 7-9 by flushing with saline. Samples were processed for small RNA sequencing and mapped for miRNAs. The differential abundance of miRNAs in UF was compared between the two groups using differential expression analysis (DESeq2). Further downstream analyses, including miRNA target gene prediction (miRTarBase), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (g:Profiler) and external validation using relevant published data, were performed on the dysregulated miRNAs. Two miRNAs were technically validated with quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR).\r\n\r\nAfter processing of the sequencing data, there were 15 samples in the healthy fertile group and 33 samples in the RIF group. We found 61 differentially abundant UF miRNAs (34 upregulated and 27 downregulated) in RIF compared to healthy women with a false discovery rate of <0.05 and a fold change (FC) of ≤-2 or ≥2. When analyzed with published literature, we found that several of the differentially abundant miRNAs are expressed in endometrial epithelial cells and have been reported in endometrial extracellular vesicles and in association with endometrial receptivity and RIF. Their predicted target genes were further expressed both in the trophectodermal cells of blastocyst-stage embryos and endometrial mid-secretory epithelial cells, as assessed by publicly available single-cell transcriptome-sequencing studies. Pathway analysis further revealed that 25 pathways, having key roles in endometrial receptivity and implantation, were significantly enriched. Hsa-miR-486-5p (FC -20.32; P-value = 0.004) and hsa-miR-92b-3p (FC -9.72; P-value = 0.004) were successfully technically validated with RT-PCR.\r\n\r\nThe data are available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ with GEO accession number: GSE173289.\r\n\r\nThis is a descriptive study with a limited number of study participants. Moreover, the identified differentially abundant miRNAs should be validated in a larger study cohort, and the predicted miRNA target genes and enriched pathways in RIF need to be confirmed and further explored in vitro.\r\n\r\nRIF is a major challenge in the current IVF setting with no diagnostic markers nor effective treatment options at hand. For the first time, total miRNAs have been extensively mapped in receptive phase UF of both healthy women with proven fertility and women diagnosed with RIF. Our observations shed further light on the molecular mechanisms behind RIF, with possible implications in future biomarker and clinical treatment studies.\r\n\r\nThis work was financially supported by the Swedish Research Council (2017-00932), a joint grant from Region Stockholm and Karolinska Institutet (ALF Medicine 2020, FoUI-954072), Estonian Research Council (PRG1076), Horizon 2020 innovation (ERIN, EU952516) and European Commission and Enterprise Estonia (EU48695).

    "abstract": "To investigate the gene-environment interaction between smoking and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using Immunochip material, on the risk of developing either of two serologically defined subsets of RA.\n\nInteraction between smoking and 133,648 genetic markers from the Immunochip was examined for two RA subsets, defined by the presence or absence of ACPA. A total of 1590 ACPA-positive and 891 ACPA-negative cases were compared with 1856 controls in the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of RA (EIRA) case-control study. Logistic regression models were used to determine the presence of interaction. The proportion attributable to interaction was calculated for each smoking-SNP pair. Replication was carried out in an independent dataset from northern Sweden. To further validate and extend the results, interaction analysis was also performed using genome-wide association studies data on EIRA individuals.\n\nIn ACPA-positive RA, 102 SNPs interacted significantly with smoking, after Bonferroni correction. All 102 SNPs were located in the HLA region, mainly within the HLA class II region, 51 of which were replicated. No additional loci outside chromosome 6 were identified in the genome-wide association studies validation. After adjusting for HLA-DRB1 shared epitope, 15 smoking-SNP pairs remained significant for ACPA-positive RA, with 8 of these replicated (loci: BTNL2, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DOB and TAP2). For ACPA-negative RA, no smoking-SNP pairs passed the threshold for significance.\n\nOur study presents extended gene variation patterns involved in gene-smoking interaction in ACPA-positive, but not ACPA-negative, RA. Notably, variants in HLA-DRB1 and those in additional genes within the MHC class II region, but not in any other gene regions, showed interaction with smoking.",

    "title": "Insight into the biology of Mycobacterium mucogenicum and Mycobacterium neoaurum clade members",
    "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacteria, NTM, are of growing concern and among these members of the Mycobacterium mucogenicum (Mmuc) and Mycobacterium neoaurum (Mneo) clades can cause infections in humans and they are resistant to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. They can be isolated from different ecological niches such as soil, tap water and ground water. Mycobacteria, such as Mmuc and Mneo, are classified as rapid growing mycobacteria, RGM, while the most familiar, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, belongs to the slow growing mycobacteria, SGM. Modern \"omics\" approaches have provided new insights into our understanding of the biology and evolution of this group of bacteria. Here we present comparative genomics data for seventeen NTM of which sixteen belong to the Mmuc- and Mneo-clades. Focusing on virulence genes, including genes encoding sigma/anti-sigma factors, serine threonine protein kinases (STPK), type VII (ESX genes) secretion systems and mammalian cell entry (Mce) factors we provide insight into their presence as well as phylogenetic relationship in the case of the sigma/anti-sigma factors and STPKs. Our data further suggest that these NTM lack ESX-5 and Mce2 genes, which are known to affect virulence. In this context, Mmuc- and Mneo-clade members lack several of the genes in the glycopeptidolipid (GLP) locus, which have roles in colony morphotype appearance and virulence. For the M. mucogenicum type strain, Mmuc T, we provide RNASeq data focusing on mRNA levels for sigma factors, STPK, ESX proteins and Mce proteins. These data are discussed and compared to in particular the SGM and fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum. Finally, we provide insight into as to why members of the Mmuc- and Mneo-clades show resistance to rifampin and isoniazid, and why MmucT forms a rough colony morphotype.",

    "title": "Elucidation of short linear motif-based interactions of the MIT and rhodanese domains of the ubiquitin-specific protease 8.",
    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) is a deubiquitinating enzyme with essential functions in protein trafficking and stability. It is a multidomain protein, with an N-terminal MIT (microtubule interacting and trafficking) domain, followed by a non-catalytic rhodanese (Rhod) domain, a long intrinsically disordered region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal MIT domain of USP8 is known to mediate protein-protein interactions through binding to short linear motifs. The non-catalytic Rhod domain is also involved in protein-protein interactions, however detailed insights into these interactions remain limited. In this study we explore the short linear motif-based interactions of the MIT and Rhod domains of USP8 using a combination of proteomic peptide-phage display, peptide arrays and deep mutational scanning. We show that the MIT domain can bind ligands with a general [DE][LIF]x{2,3}R[FYIL]xxL[LV] consensus motif. We uncover that the rhodanese domain of USP8 is a peptide-binding domain, and define two distinct binding motifs (Rx[LI]xGxxxPxxL and G[LV][DE][IM]WExKxxxLxE) for this domain by deep mutational scanning of two different peptide ligands. Using the motif information, we predict binding sites within known USP8 interactors and substrates and validate interactions through peptide array analysis. Our findings demonstrate that both the USP8 MIT and rhodanese domains are peptide-binding domains that can be bound by degenerate and distinct binding motifs. The detailed information on the peptide binding preference of the two N-terminal domains of USP8 provide novel insights into the molecular recognition events that underlie the function of this essential deubiquitinating enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Adverse skin reactions during radiotherapy (RT) are common. The aim of this study was to explore whether genetic variation might be linked to acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR).\n\nOne hundred and nineteen women undergoing adjuvant RT for breast cancer were included. The symptoms of itching, burning and irritation were self-reported twice using the visual analogue scale. Assessments used the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system for acute RT skin reaction (RTOG scale). Blood-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed. Thirty SNPs of well-defined functional genes were investigated.\n\nAll women were assessed with ARSR. After RT, the women self-reported itching (n=97), burning (n=64) and irritation (n=96). Two SNPs in X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 2 gene (XRCC2) rs2040639 and interferon gamma (IFNG) rs2069705 genes were found to be associated with ARSR.\n\nAn association between two SNPs and ARSR was found. The possibility of using these SNPs as prognostic biomarkers for ARSR as tools to improve the care of patients needs further investigation.",

    "title": "Association of Chromosome 9p21 with Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease Events: A GENIUS-CHD Study of Individual Participant Data.",
    "abstract": "Genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 is a recognized risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, its effect on disease progression and subsequent events is unclear, raising questions about its value for stratification of residual risk.\n\nA variant at chromosome 9p21 (rs1333049) was tested for association with subsequent events during follow-up in 103,357 Europeans with established CHD at baseline from the GENIUS-CHD Consortium (73.1% male, mean age 62.9 years). The primary outcome, subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction (CHD death/MI), occurred in 13,040 of the 93,115 participants with available outcome data. Effect estimates were compared to case/control risk obtained from CARDIoGRAMPlusC4D including 47,222 CHD cases and 122,264 controls free of CHD.\n\nMeta-analyses revealed no significant association between chromosome 9p21 and the primary outcome of CHD death/MI among those with established CHD at baseline (GENIUS-CHD OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.99-1.05). This contrasted with a strong association in CARDIoGRAMPlusC4D OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.18-1.22; p for interaction Conclusions: In contrast to studies comparing individuals with CHD to disease free controls, we found no clear association between genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 and risk of subsequent acute CHD events when all individuals had CHD at baseline. However, the association with subsequent revascularization may support the postulated mechanism of chromosome 9p21 for promoting atheroma development.",

    "title": "Stop codon readthrough alters the activity of a POU/Oct transcription factor during Drosophila development.",
    "abstract": "A number of cellular processes have evolved in metazoans that increase the proteome repertoire in relation to the genome, such as alternative splicing and translation recoding. Another such process, translational stop codon readthrough (SCR), generates C-terminally extended protein isoforms in many eukaryotes, including yeast, plants, insects, and humans. While comparative genome analyses have predicted the existence of programmed SCR in many species including humans, experimental proof of its functional consequences are scarce.\n\nWe show that SCR of the Drosophila POU/Oct transcription factor Ventral veins lacking/Drifter (Vvl/Dfr) mRNA is prevalent in certain tissues in vivo, reaching a rate of 50% in the larval prothoracic gland. Phylogenetically, the C-terminal extension is conserved and harbors intrinsically disordered regions and amino acid stretches implied in transcriptional activation. Elimination of Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis changed the expression of a large number of downstream genes involved in processes such as chromatin regulation, neurogenesis, development, and immune response. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that the C-terminal extension of Vvl/Dfr is necessary for correct timing of pupariation, by increasing the capacity to regulate its target genes. The extended Vvl/Dfr isoform acts in synergy with the transcription factor Molting defective (Mld) to increase the expression and biosynthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone, thereby advancing pupariation. Consequently, late-stage larval development was prolonged and metamorphosis delayed in vvl/dfr readthrough mutants.\n\nWe demonstrate that translational recoding of a POU/Oct transcription factor takes place in a highly tissue-specific and temporally controlled manner. This dynamic and regulated recoding is necessary for normal expression of a large number of genes involved in many cellular and developmental processes. Loss of Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough negatively affects steroid hormone biosynthesis and delays larval development and progression into metamorphosis. Thus, this study demonstrates how SCR of a transcription factor can act as a developmental switch in a spatiotemporal manner, feeding into the timing of developmental transitions between different life-cycle stages.",

    "title": "Robust derivation of transplantable dopamine neurons from human pluripotent stem cells by timed retinoic acid delivery.",
    "abstract": "Stem cell therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) have entered first-in-human clinical trials using a set of technically related methods to produce mesencephalic dopamine (mDA) neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here, we outline an approach for high-yield derivation of mDA neurons that principally differs from alternative technologies by utilizing retinoic acid (RA) signaling, instead of WNT and FGF8 signaling, to specify mesencephalic fate. Unlike most morphogen signals, where precise concentration determines cell fate, it is the duration of RA exposure that is the key-parameter for mesencephalic specification. This concentration-insensitive patterning approach provides robustness and reduces the need for protocol-adjustments between hPSC-lines. RA-specified progenitors promptly differentiate into functional mDA neurons in vitro, and successfully engraft and relieve motor deficits after transplantation in a rat PD model. Our study provides a potential alternative route for cell therapy and disease modelling that due to its robustness could be particularly expedient when use of autologous- or immunologically matched cells is considered.",

    "abstract": "Two Gram-negative, rod-shaped strains, T2.1(T) and W5.1.1(T), isolated from larvae of the mosquito Anopheles arabiensis, were investigated using a polyphasic approach. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies, strains T2.1(T) and W5.1.1(T) were shown to belong to the genus Thorsellia, both showing 97.8 % similarity to the type strain of Thorsellia anophelis, with 98.1 % similarity to each other. Chemotaxonomic data supported the allocation of the strains to the genus Thorsellia: their major fatty acids were C18 : 1ω7c, C16 : 0 and C14 : 0 and they harboured a ubiquinone Q-8 quinone system and a polyamine pattern with the major compound 1,3-diaminopropane. Qualitative and quantitative differences in their polar lipid profiles distinguished strains T2.1(T) and W5.1.1(T) from each other and from T. anophelis. Average nucleotide identity (ANI), DNA-DNA hybridization, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) as well as physiological and biochemical tests allowed T2.1(T) and W5.1.1(T) to be distinguished both genotypically and phenotypically from each other and from the type strain of T. anophelis. Thus, we propose that these isolates represent two novel species of the genus Thorsellia, named Thorsellia kenyensis sp. nov. (type strain T2.1(T) = CCM 8545(T) = LMG 28483(T) = CIP 110829(T)) and Thorsellia kandunguensis sp. nov. (type strain W5.1.1(T) = LMG 28213(T) = CIP 110794(T)). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the genus Thorsellia forms a separate branch, distinct from the families Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and Orbaceae. As a consequence, a new family Thorselliaceae fam. nov. is proposed. An emended description of Thorsellia anophelis is also provided.",

    "abstract": "The Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) region is located in northeastern Quebec and is known for its unique demographic history and founder effect. As founder populations are enriched with population-specific variants, we characterized the variants distribution in SLSJ and compared it with four European populations (Finnish, Sweden, United Kingdom and France), of which the Finnish population is another founder population. Targeted sequencing of the coding and non-coding immune regulatory regions of the SLSJ asthma familial cohort and the four European populations were performed. Rare and low-frequency coding and non-coding regulatory variants identified in the SLSJ population were then investigated for variant- and gene-level associations with asthma and allergy-related traits (eosinophil percentage, immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels and lung function). Our data showed that (1) rare or deleterious variants were not enriched in the two founder populations as compared with the three non-founder European populations; (2) a larger proportion of founder population-specific variants occurred with higher frequencies; and (3) low-frequency variants appeared to be more deleterious. Furthermore, a rare variant, rs1386931, located in the 3'-UTR of CXCR6 and intron of FYCO1 was found to be associated with eosinophil percentage. Gene-based analyses identified NRP2, MRPL44 and SERPINE2 to be associated with various asthma and allergy-related traits. Our study demonstrated the usefulness of using a founder population to identify new genes associated with asthma and allergy-related traits; thus better understand the genes and pathways implicated in pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The role of DNA methylation in aging has been widely studied. However, epigenetic mutations, here defined as aberrant methylation levels compared to the distribution in a population, are less understood. Hence, we investigated longitudinal accumulation of epigenetic mutations, using 994 blood samples collected at up to five time points from 375 individuals in old ages.\n\nWe verified earlier cross-sectional evidence on the increase of epigenetic mutations with age, and identified important contributing factors including sex, CD19+ B cells, genetic background, cancer diagnosis, and technical artifacts. We further classified epigenetic mutations into High/Low Methylation Outliers (HMO/LMO) according to their changes in methylation, and specifically studied methylation sites (CpGs) that were prone to mutate (frequently mutated CpGs). We validated four epigenetically mutated CpGs using pyrosequencing in 93 samples. Furthermore, by using twins, we concluded that the age-related accumulation of epigenetic mutations was not related to genetic factors, hence driven by stochastic or environmental effects.\n\nHere we conducted a comprehensive study of epigenetic mutation and highlighted its important role in aging process and cancer development.",

    "abstract": "The genetic background in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors is poorly understood, but several studies have revealed numerical imbalances. Loss of one copy of chromosome 18 is the most frequent genetic aberration in this tumor type, which indirectly suggests that a driver mutation may be present in the remaining allele. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mutation status on chromosome 18 in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors. DNAs from 7 small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors were subjected to whole exome capture, followed by next generation sequencing and high resolution SNP array followed by copy number variation analysis. Exome capture sequencing generated an average coverage of 50.6-138.2. Only 19 genes were covered less than 8X. No tumor-specific somatic mutation was identified. Genomic profiling revealed loss of chromosome 18 in 5 out of 7 small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors and a number of other aberrancies. Loss of chromosome 18 is the most frequent genetic aberration in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors, but no evidence for eventual mutations in the remaining allele. This suggests involvement of other mechanisms than point mutations in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors tumorigenesis.",

    "title": "Features of increased malignancy in eosinophilic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of renal cancer. Due to inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are constitutively activated in these tumours, resulting in a pseudo-hypoxic phenotype. The HIFs induce the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and cell survival, but they also reset the cellular metabolism to protect cells from oxygen and nutrient deprivation. ccRCC tumours are highly vascularized and the cytoplasm of the cancer cells is filled with lipid droplets and glycogen, resulting in the histologically distinctive pale (clear) cytoplasm. Intratumoural heterogeneity may occur, and in some tumours, areas with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm are found. Little is known regarding these traits and how they relate to the coexistent clear cell component, yet eosinophilic ccRCC is associated with higher grade and clinically more aggressive tumours. In this study, we have for the first time performed RNA sequencing comparing histologically verified clear cell and eosinophilic areas from ccRCC tissue, aiming to analyse the characteristics of these cell types. Findings from RNA sequencing were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of biphasic ccRCC. We found that the eosinophilic phenotype displayed a higher proliferative drive and lower differentiation, and we confirmed a correlation to tumours of higher stage. We further identified mutations of the tumour suppressor p53 (TP53) exclusively in the eosinophilic ccRCC component, where mTORC1 activity was also elevated. Also, eosinophilic areas were less vascularized, yet harboured more abundant infiltrating immune cells. The cytoplasm of clear cell ccRCC cells was filled with lipids but had very low mitochondrial content, while the reverse was found in eosinophilic tissue. We herein suggest possible transcriptional mechanisms behind these phenomena. © 2020 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Distyly, an example of convergent evolution, is governed by a supergene, the S-locus, in several species. Recent studies highlight similar genomic architectures of independently evolved S-loci, but its mode of origin and whether similar regulatory pathways underlie the convergent evolution of distyly remains unclear. We examined the evolution of supergenes and mechanisms underlying distyly in Linum species that diverged c. 33 million years ago (Ma). Using haplotype-resolved genomes and population genomics, we identified and characterized the S-loci of Linum perenne (distylous) and Linum grandiflorum (style length dimorphic), and compared them to that of Linum tenue (distylous). We then tested for a conserved hormonal mechanism regulating style length polymorphism in Linum. The S-locus supergene was consistently hemizygous in short-styled individuals across all three species, although it showed variation in size, gene content, repeat elements and extent of recombination suppression. Two S-linked candidate genes, TSS1 (style length) and WDR-44 (anther height/pollen self-incompatibility), were conserved. Consistent with a brassinosteroid-dependent role of TSS1, epibrassinolide treatment revealed a conserved, morph-specific effect on style length. S-locus structural polymorphism, candidate distyly genes and mechanisms regulating style length remain conserved > 30 Ma in Linum. In combination with findings from other systems, our results suggest that the brassinosteroid pathway frequently contributes to style length polymorphism.",

    "title": "Expression of BCL6 in paediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and association with prognosis.",
    "abstract": "B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is the most common paediatric malignancy. Transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is essential to germinal centre formation and antibody affinity maturation and plays a major role in mature B-cell malignancies. More recently, it was shown to act as a critical downstream regulator in pre-BCR+ B-ALL. We investigated the expression of the BCL6 protein in a population-based cohort of paediatric B-ALL cases and detected moderate to strong positivity through immunohistochemistry in 7% of cases (8/117); however, only two of eight BCL6 cases (25%) co-expressed the ZAP70 protein. In light of these data, the subtype with active pre-BCR signalling constitutes a rare entity in paediatric B-ALL. In three independent larger cohorts with gene expression data, high BCL6 mRNA levels were associated with the TCF3-PBX1, Ph-like, NUTM1, MEF2D and PAX5-alt subgroups and the 'metagene' signature for pre-BCR-associated genes. However, higher-than-median BCL6 mRNA level alone was associated with favourable event free survival in the Nordic paediatric cohort, indicating that using BCL6 as a diagnostic marker requires careful design, and evaluation of protein level is needed alongside the genetic or transcriptomic data.",

    "title": "Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy is associated with genes related to immunity and neuronal survival.",
    "abstract": "The incidence of narcolepsy rose sharply after the swine influenza A (H1N1) vaccination campaign with Pandemrix. Narcolepsy is an immune-related disorder with excessive daytime sleepiness. The most frequent form is strongly associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02, but only a minority of carriers develop narcolepsy. We aimed to identify genetic markers that predispose to Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy.\n\nWe tested for genome-wide and candidate gene associations in 42 narcolepsy cases and 4981 controls. Genotyping was performed on Illumina arrays, HLA alleles were imputed using SNP2HLA, and single nucleotide polymorphisms were imputed using the haplotype reference consortium panel. The genome-wide significance threshold was p < 5 × 10\n                -8, and the nominal threshold was p < 0.05. Results were replicated in 32 cases and 7125 controls. Chromatin data was used for functional annotation.\n\nCarrying HLA-DQB1*06:02 was significantly associated with narcolepsy, odds ratio (OR) 39.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.3, 137], p = 7.9 × 10\n                -9. After adjustment for HLA, GDNF-AS1 (rs62360233) was significantly associated, OR = 8.7 [95% CI 4.2, 17.5], p = 2.6 × 10-9, and this was replicated, OR = 3.4 [95% CI 1.2-9.6], p = 0.022. Functional analysis revealed variants in high LD with rs62360233 that might explain the detected association. The candidate immune-gene locus TRAJ (rs1154155) was nominally associated in both the discovery and replication cohorts, meta-analysis OR = 2.0 [95% CI 1.4, 2.8], p = 0.0002.\n\nWe found a novel association between Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy and the non-coding RNA gene GDNF-AS1, which has been shown to regulate expression of the essential neurotrophic factor GDNF. Changes in regulation of GDNF have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This finding may increase the understanding of disease mechanisms underlying narcolepsy. Associations between Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy and immune-related genes were replicated.",

    "abstract": "ER-positive/HER2-negative (ERpHER2n) breast cancer classified as PAM50 HER2-enriched (ERpHER2n-HER2E) represents a small high-risk patient subgroup. In this study, we investigate genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical features of ERpHER2n-HER2E breast tumors using two primary ERpHER2n cohorts comprising a total of 5640 patients. We show that ERpHER2n-HER2E tumors exhibit aggressive clinical features and poorer clinical outcomes compared to Luminal A and Luminal B tumors. Furthermore, ERpHER2n-HER2E breast cancer does not consist of misclassified or HER2-low cases, has little impact of ERBB2, is highly proliferative and less ER dependent than other luminal subtypes. It is not an obvious biological entity but is nevertheless associated with potentially targetable molecular features, notably a high immune response and high FGFR4 expression. Strikingly, molecular features that define the HER2E subtype in luminal disease are also consistent in HER2-positive disease, including an epigenetic mechanism for high FGFR4 expression in breast cancer.",

    "title": "Oxygen induces the expression of invasion and stress response genes in the anaerobic salmon parasite Spironucleus salmonicida.",
    "abstract": "Spironucleus salmonicida is an anaerobic parasite that can cause systemic infections in Atlantic salmon. Unlike other diplomonad parasites, such as the human pathogen Giardia intestinalis, Spironucleus species can infiltrate the blood stream of their hosts eventually colonizing organs, skin and gills. How this presumed anaerobe can persist and invade oxygenated tissues, despite having a strictly anaerobic metabolism, remains elusive.\n\nTo investigate how S. salmonicida response to oxygen stress, we performed RNAseq transcriptomic analyses of cells grown in the presence of oxygen or antioxidant-free medium. We found that over 20% of the transcriptome is differentially regulated in oxygen (1705 genes) and antioxidant-depleted (2280 genes) conditions. These differentially regulated transcripts encode proteins related to anaerobic metabolism, cysteine and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, as well as a large number of proteins of unknown function. S. salmonicida does not encode genes involved in the classical elements of oxygen metabolism (e.g., catalases, superoxide dismutase, glutathione biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation). Instead, we found that genes encoding bacterial-like oxidoreductases were upregulated in response to oxygen stress. Phylogenetic analysis revealed some of these oxygen-responsive genes (e.g., nadh oxidase, rubrerythrin, superoxide reductase) are rare in eukaryotes and likely derived from lateral gene transfer (LGT) events into diplomonads from prokaryotes. Unexpectedly, we observed that many host evasion- and invasion-related genes were also upregulated under oxidative stress suggesting that oxygen might be an important signal for pathogenesis.\n\nWhile oxygen is toxic for related organisms, such as G. intestinalis, we find that oxygen is likely a gene induction signal for host invasion- and evasion-related pathways in S. salmonicida. These data provide the first molecular evidence for how S. salmonicida could tolerate oxic host environments and demonstrate how LGT can have a profound impact on the biology of anaerobic parasites.",

    "abstract": "HLA-DRB1 alleles have been associated with several autoimmune diseases. For anti-citrullinated protein antibody positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles are the major genetic risk factors. In order to study the genetic regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II gene expression in immune cells, we investigated transcriptomic profiles of a variety of immune cells from healthy individuals carrying different HLA-DRB1 alleles. Sequencing libraries from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD14+ monocytes of 32 genetically pre-selected healthy female individuals were generated, sequenced and reads were aligned to the standard reference. For the MHC region, reads were mapped to available MHC reference haplotypes and AltHapAlignR was used to estimate gene expression. Using this method, HLA-DRB and HLA-DQ were found to be differentially expressed in different immune cells of healthy individuals as well as in whole blood samples of RA patients carrying HLA-DRB1 SE-positive versus SE-negative alleles. In contrast, no genes outside the MHC region were differentially expressed between individuals carrying HLA-DRB1 SE-positive and SE-negative alleles, thus HLA-DRB1 SE alleles have a strong cis effect on gene expression. Altogether, our findings suggest that immune effects associated with different allelic forms of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ may be associated not only with differences in the structure of these proteins, but also with differences in their expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Childhood neuroblastoma has a remarkable variability in outcome. Age at diagnosis is one of the most important prognostic factors, with children less than 1 year old having favorable outcomes. Here we study single-cell and single-nuclei transcriptomes of neuroblastoma with different clinical risk groups and stages, including healthy adrenal gland. We compare tumor cell populations with embryonic mouse sympatho-adrenal derivatives, and post-natal human adrenal gland. We provide evidence that low and high-risk neuroblastoma have different cell identities, representing two disease entities. Low-risk neuroblastoma presents a transcriptome that resembles sympatho- and chromaffin cells, whereas malignant cells enriched in high-risk neuroblastoma resembles a subtype of TRKB+ cholinergic progenitor population identified in human post-natal gland. Analyses of these populations reveal different gene expression programs for worst and better survival in correlation with age at diagnosis. Our findings reveal two cellular identities and a composition of human neuroblastoma tumors reflecting clinical heterogeneity and outcome.",

    "title": "Development of a highly efficient 50K single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping array for the large and complex genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) by whole genome resequencing and its transferability to other spruce species.",
    "abstract": "Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) is one of the most important forest tree species with significant economic and ecological impact in Europe. For decades, genomic and genetic studies on Norway spruce have been challenging due to the large and repetitive genome (19.6 Gb with more than 70% being repetitive). To accelerate genomic studies, including population genetics, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS), in Norway spruce and related species, we here report on the design and performance of a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array for Norway spruce. The array is developed based on whole genome resequencing (WGS), making it the first WGS-based SNP array in any conifer species so far. After identifying SNPs using genome resequencing data from 29 trees collected in northern Europe, we adopted a two-step approach to design the array. First, we built a 450K screening array and used this to genotype a population of 480 trees sampled from both natural and breeding populations across the Norway spruce distribution range. These samples were then used to select high-confidence probes that were put on the final 50K array. The SNPs selected are distributed over 45,552 scaffolds from the P. abies version 1.0 genome assembly and target 19,954 unique gene models with an even coverage of the 12 linkage groups in Norway spruce. We show that the array has a 99.5% probe specificity, >98% Mendelian allelic inheritance concordance, an average sample call rate of 96.30% and an SNP call rate of 98.90% in family trios and haploid tissues. We also observed that 23,797 probes (50%) could be identified with high confidence in three other spruce species (white spruce [Picea glauca], black spruce [P. mariana] and Sitka spruce [P. sitchensis]). The high-quality genotyping array will be a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies in Norway spruce as well as in other conifer species of the same genus.",

    "title": "Streamlined and Abundant Bacterioplankton Thrive in Functional Cohorts.",
    "abstract": "While fastidious microbes can be abundant and ubiquitous in their natural communities, many fail to grow axenically in laboratories due to auxotrophies or other dependencies. To overcome auxotrophies, these microbes rely on their surrounding cohort. A cohort may consist of kin (ecotypes) or more distantly related organisms (community) with the cooperation being reciprocal or nonreciprocal and expensive (Black Queen hypothesis) or costless (by-product). These metabolic partnerships (whether at single species population or community level) enable dominance by and coexistence of these lineages in nature. Here we examine the relevance of these cooperation models to explain the abundance and ubiquity of the dominant fastidious bacterioplankton of a dimictic mesotrophic freshwater lake. Using both culture-dependent (dilution mixed cultures) and culture-independent (small subunit [SSU] rRNA gene time series and environmental metagenomics) methods, we independently identified the primary cohorts of actinobacterial genera \"Candidatus Planktophila\" (acI-A) and \"Candidatus Nanopelagicus\" (acI-B) and the proteobacterial genus \"Candidatus Fonsibacter\" (LD12). While \"Ca Planktophila\" and \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" had no correlation in their natural habitat, they have the potential to be complementary in laboratory settings. We also investigated the bifunctional catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG (a common good which \"Ca Planktophila\" is dependent upon) and its most likely providers in the lake. Further, we found that while ecotype and community cooperation combined may explain \"Ca Planktophila\" population abundance, the success of \"Ca. Nanopelagicus\" and \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" is better explained as a community by-product. Ecotype differentiation of \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" as a means of escaping predation was supported but not for overcoming auxotrophies.IMPORTANCE This study examines evolutionary and ecological relationships of three of the most ubiquitous and abundant freshwater bacterial genera: \"Ca Planktophila\" (acI-A), \"Ca. Nanopelagicus\" (acI-B), and \"Ca. Fonsibacter\" (LD12). Due to high abundance, these genera might have a significant influence on nutrient cycling in freshwaters worldwide, and this study adds a layer of understanding to how seemingly competing clades of bacteria can coexist by having different cooperation strategies. Our synthesis ties together network and ecological theory with empirical evidence and lays out a framework for how the functioning of populations within complex microbial communities can be studied.",

    "title": "River biofilms adapted to anthropogenic disturbances are more resistant to WWTP inputs.",
    "abstract": "The sensitivity and spatial recovery of river sediment biofilms along 1 km after the input of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in two river reaches with different degrees of anthropogenic influence were investigated. First, at the upper reach, we observed an inhibition of some microbial functions (microbial respiration and extracellular enzyme activities) and strong shifts in bacterial community composition (16S rRNA gene), whereas an increase in microbial biomass and activity and less pronounced effect on microbial diversity and community composition were seen at the lower reach. Second, at the lower reach we observed a quick spatial recovery (around 200 m downstream of the effluent) as most of the functions and community composition were similar to those from reference sites. On the other hand, bacterial community composition and water quality at the upper reach was still altered 1 km from the WWTP effluent. Our results indicate that biofilms in the upstream sites were more sensitive to the effect of WWTPs due to a lower degree of tolerance after a disturbance than communities located in more anthropogenically impacted sites.",

    "title": "Seasonal and age-related changes in sperm quality of farmed arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus).",
    "abstract": "Substantial variation in male fertility is regularly observed in farmed Arctic charr. However, detailed investigations of its fluctuation during a reproductive season and across years are lacking. Furthermore, information about the effect of underlying genetic factors influencing sperm quality is scarce. The current study focused on seasonal and age-related factors that may affect sperm quality characteristics in males reared in natural and delayed photoperiods. Animals were sampled three times for two consecutive years, and sperm quality parameters were recorded using a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system. Thereafter, high-throughput sequencing technologies were applied, aiming to identify genomic regions related to the variation of sperm quality throughout the reproductive season.\n\nAn across-season variation in the recorded sperm quality parameters was evident. Overall, 29% and 42% of males from the natural and delayed spawning groups had a highly variable total progressive motility. Males at four years of age showed significantly higher sperm motility and velocities during the early October and November recordings compared to the following year when the same animals were five years of age. On the other hand, the opposite was observed regarding sperm concentration during the last sampling. A genome-wide FST scan detected SNP differentiation among males with high and low variability in total progressive motility (PM) on eight chromosomes (FST > 0.17), Genome wide windows with the highest FST contained SNPs in proximity (within 250 kb up- and downstream distance) to 16 genes with sperm quality biological functions in mammalian species.\n\nOur findings provide a detailed view of seasonal, age-related, and genetic effects on sperm quality and can be used to guide decisions on broodstock selection and hatchery management.",
