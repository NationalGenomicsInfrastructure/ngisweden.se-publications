    "title": "Identification of new TRIP12 variants and detailed clinical evaluation of individuals with non-syndromic intellectual disability with or without autism.",
    "abstract": "The ubiquitin pathway is an enzymatic cascade including activating E1, conjugating E2, and ligating E3 enzymes, which governs protein degradation and sorting. It is crucial for many physiological processes. Compromised function of members of the ubiquitin pathway leads to a wide range of human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12 (TRIP12) gene (OMIM 604506), which encodes an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin pathway, have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition to autistic features, TRIP12 mutation carriers showed intellectual disability (ID). More recently, TRIP12 was postulated as a novel candidate gene for intellectual disability in a meta-analysis of published ID cohorts. However, detailed clinical information characterizing the phenotype of these individuals was not provided. In this study, we present seven novel individuals with private TRIP12 mutations including two splice site mutations, one nonsense mutation, three missense mutations, and one translocation case with a breakpoint in intron 1 of the TRIP12 gene and clinically review four previously published cases. The TRIP12 mutation-positive individuals presented with mild to moderate ID (10/11) or learning disability [intelligence quotient (IQ) 76 in one individual], ASD (8/11) and some of them with unspecific craniofacial dysmorphism and other anomalies. In this study, we provide detailed clinical information of 11 TRIP12 mutation-positive individuals and thereby expand the clinical spectrum of the TRIP12 gene in non-syndromic intellectual disability with or without ASD.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamin; 5-HT) system has a central role in the circuitry of cognition and emotions. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4; 5-HTT) is associated with schizophrenia and suicidal behavior. In this study, we wanted to elucidate whether SLC6A4 variations is involved in attempted suicide among patients with schizophrenia in a Scandinavian case-control sample.\n\nPatients diagnosed with schizophrenia from three Scandinavian samples were assessed for presence or absence of suicide attempts, based on record reviews and interview data. Seven SLC6A4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 837 schizophrenia patients and 1,473 control individuals. Association analyses and statistical evaluations were performed with the program UNPHASED (version 3.0.9).\n\nWe observed an allele association between the SNP rs16965628, located in intron one of SLC6A4, and attempted suicide (adjusted p-value 0.01), among patients with schizophrenia. No association was found to a diagnosis of schizophrenia, when patients were compared to healthy control individuals.\n\nThe gene SLC6A4 appears to be involved in suicidal ideation among patients with schizophrenia. Independent replication is needed before more firm conclusions can be drawn.",

    "abstract": "Although adaptive divergence along environmental gradients has repeatedly been demonstrated, the role of post-glacial colonization routes in determining phenotypic variation along gradients has received little attention. Here, we used a hierarchical Q ST -FST approach to separate the roles of adaptive and neutral processes in shaping phenotypic variation in moor frog (Rana arvalis) larval life histories along a 1,700 km latitudinal gradient across northern Europe. This species has colonized Scandinavia via two routes with a contact zone in northern Sweden. By using neutral SNP and common garden phenotypic data from 13 populations at two temperatures, we showed that most of the variation along the gradient occurred between the two colonizing lineages. We found little phenotypic divergence within the lineages; however, all phenotypic traits were strongly diverged between the southern and northern colonization routes, with higher growth and development rates and larger body size in the north. The QST estimates between the colonization routes were four times higher than FST , indicating a prominent role for natural selection. QST within the colonization routes did not generally differ from FST , but we found temperature-dependent adaptive divergence close to the contact zone. These results indicate that lineage-specific variation can account for much of the adaptive divergence along a latitudinal gradient.",

    "abstract": "The aetiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) remains unknown. Individuals may share features of genetic susceptibility, and there may also be a hereditary component. The aim was to identify patterns of association and segregation for genetic variants and to identify the genes and signalling pathways that determine the risk of developing RAS, through a family-based genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n\nDNA was extracted from buccal swabs of 91 individuals in 16 families and analysed in an Illumina core exome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A family-based association test (dFAM) was used to derive SNP association values across all chromosomes.\n\nNone of the final 288,452 SNPs reached the genome-wide significant threshold of 5 × 10-8 . The most significant pathways were the Ras and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways, pathways in cancer, circadian entrainment and the Rap 1 signalling pathway.\n\nThis confirms that RAS is not monogenic but results as a consequence of interactions between multiple host genes and possibly also environmental factors. The present approach provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying RAS and raises the possibility of identifying individuals at risk of acquiring this condition.",

    "title": "Tissue-specific patterns of regulatory changes underlying gene expression differences among Ficedula flycatchers and their naturally occurring F1 hybrids.",
    "abstract": "Changes in interacting cis- and trans-regulatory elements are important candidates for Dobzhansky-Muller hybrid incompatibilities and may contribute to hybrid dysfunction by giving rise to misexpression in hybrids. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms and determinants of gene expression evolution in natural populations, we analyzed the transcriptome from multiple tissues of two recently diverged Ficedula flycatcher species and their naturally occurring F1 hybrids. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that the extent of differentiation between species and the set of differentially expressed genes varied across tissues. Common to all tissues, a higher proportion of Z-linked genes than autosomal genes showed differential expression, providing evidence for a fast-Z effect. We further found clear signatures of hybrid misexpression in brain, heart, kidney, and liver. However, while testis showed the highest divergence of gene expression among tissues, it showed no clear signature of misexpression in F1 hybrids, even though these hybrids were found to be sterile. It is therefore unlikely that incompatibilities between cis-trans regulatory changes explain the observed sterility. Instead, we found evidence that cis-regulatory changes play a significant role in the evolution of gene expression in testis, which illustrates the tissue-specific nature of cis-regulatory evolution bypassing constraints associated with pleiotropic effects of genes.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have previously identified 23 genetic loci associated with circulating fibrinogen concentration. These studies used HapMap imputation and did not examine the X-chromosome. 1000 Genomes imputation provides better coverage of uncommon variants, and includes indels. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis of 34 studies imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel and including ∼120 000 participants of European ancestry (95 806 participants with data on the X-chromosome). Approximately 10.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 1.2 million indels were examined. We identified 41 genome-wide significant fibrinogen loci; of which, 18 were newly identified. There were no genome-wide significant signals on the X-chromosome. The lead variants of five significant loci were indels. We further identified six additional independent signals, including three rare variants, at two previously characterized loci: FGB and IRF1. Together the 41 loci explain 3% of the variance in plasma fibrinogen concentration.",

    "title": "Evidence for three genetic loci involved in both anorexia nervosa risk and variation of body mass index.",
    "abstract": "The maintenance of normal body weight is disrupted in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) for prolonged periods of time. Prior to the onset of AN, premorbid body mass index (BMI) spans the entire range from underweight to obese. After recovery, patients have reduced rates of overweight and obesity. As such, loci involved in body weight regulation may also be relevant for AN and vice versa. Our primary analysis comprised a cross-trait analysis of the 1000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the lowest P-values in a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of AN (GCAN) for evidence of association in the largest published GWAMA for BMI (GIANT). Subsequently we performed sex-stratified analyses for these 1000 SNPs. Functional ex vivo studies on four genes ensued. Lastly, a look-up of GWAMA-derived BMI-related loci was performed in the AN GWAMA. We detected significant associations (P-values <5 × 10(-5), Bonferroni-corrected P<0.05) for nine SNP alleles at three independent loci. Interestingly, all AN susceptibility alleles were consistently associated with increased BMI. None of the genes (chr. 10: CTBP2, chr. 19: CCNE1, chr. 2: CARF and NBEAL1; the latter is a region with high linkage disequilibrium) nearest to these SNPs has previously been associated with AN or obesity. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the strongest BMI signal originated predominantly from females (chr. 10 rs1561589; Poverall: 2.47 × 10(-06)/Pfemales: 3.45 × 10(-07)/Pmales: 0.043). Functional ex vivo studies in mice revealed reduced hypothalamic expression of Ctbp2 and Nbeal1 after fasting. Hypothalamic expression of Ctbp2 was increased in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice as compared with age-matched lean controls. We observed no evidence for associations for the look-up of BMI-related loci in the AN GWAMA. A cross-trait analysis of AN and BMI loci revealed variants at three chromosomal loci with potential joint impact. The chromosome 10 locus is particularly promising given that the association with obesity was primarily driven by females. In addition, the detected altered hypothalamic expression patterns of Ctbp2 and Nbeal1 as a result of fasting and DIO implicate these genes in weight regulation.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a twin cohort.\n\nA total of 12 590 twins were analysed for the presence of ACPAs (CCP2 ELISA), HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) gene alleles, and exposure to smoking. Twins with established RA were identified in national public care registers. Antibody reactivities against citrullinated and native forms of α-enolase, vimentin, fibrinogen and type II collagen peptides were tested by ELISA in anti-CCP2-positive subjects and their cotwins. Structural equation models and ORs for the development of ACPA and ACPA-positive RA were computed for smokers and SE carriers.\n\nA total of 2.8% (350/12 590) of the twins were ACPA positive, and 1.0% (124/12 590) had ACPA-positive RA. Most of the variability in the ACPA status was accounted for by non-shared environmental or stochastic factors (78%, 95% CI 55% to 100%) rather than shared environmental and genetic factors. Analysis of specific risk factors revealed an association between smoking and SE and the presence of ACPAs. Twins with ACPA-positive RA were more frequently SE positive than twins with ACPAs without RA. Reactivities against multiple citrullinated peptides were present in most twins with ACPA-positive RA but in fewer twins with ACPAs without RA.\n\nEnvironment, lifestyle and stochastic factors may be more important than genetics in determining which individuals develop ACPAs. Genetic factors (particularly SE) may have a relatively larger role in determining which ACPA-positive individuals will ultimately develop arthritis.",

    "title": "Standing genetic variation as a major contributor to adaptation in the Virginia chicken lines selection experiment.",
    "abstract": "Artificial selection provides a powerful approach to study the genetics of adaptation. Using selective-sweep mapping, it is possible to identify genomic regions where allele-frequencies have diverged during selection. To avoid false positive signatures of selection, it is necessary to show that a sweep affects a selected trait before it can be considered adaptive. Here, we confirm candidate, genome-wide distributed selective sweeps originating from the standing genetic variation in a long-term selection experiment on high and low body weight of chickens.\n\nUsing an intercross between the two divergent chicken lines, 16 adaptive selective sweeps were confirmed based on their association with the body weight at 56 days of age. Although individual additive effects were small, the fixation for alternative alleles across the loci contributed at least 40 % of the phenotypic difference for the selected trait between these lines. The sweeps contributed about half of the additive genetic variance present within and between the lines after 40 generations of selection, corresponding to a considerable portion of the additive genetic variance of the base population.\n\nLong-term, single-trait, bi-directional selection in the Virginia chicken lines has resulted in a gradual response to selection for extreme phenotypes without a drastic reduction in the genetic variation. We find that fixation of several standing genetic variants across a highly polygenic genetic architecture made a considerable contribution to long-term selection response. This provides new fundamental insights into the dynamics of standing genetic variation during long-term selection and adaptation.",

    "title": "The relative contribution of DNA methylation and genetic variants on protein biomarkers for human diseases.",
    "abstract": "Associations between epigenetic alterations and disease status have been identified for many diseases. However, there is no strong evidence that epigenetic alterations are directly causal for disease pathogenesis. In this study, we combined SNP and DNA methylation data with measurements of protein biomarkers for cancer, inflammation or cardiovascular disease, to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation on biomarker levels. A total of 121 protein biomarkers were measured and analyzed in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions and to over 10 million SNPs. We performed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses, and integrated biomarker, DNA methylation and SNP data using between 698 and 1033 samples depending on data availability for the different analyses. We identified 124 and 45 loci (Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.05) with effect sizes up to 0.22 standard units' change per 1% change in DNA methylation levels and up to four standard units' change per copy of the effective allele in the EWAS and GWAS respectively. Most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory whereas most EWAS loci were located in trans. Eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one in NLRC5 associated with CXCL11, CXCL9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels. All EWAS signals that overlapped with a GWAS locus were driven by underlying genetic variants and three EWAS signals were confounded by smoking. While some cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers appeared to have an effect also on DNA methylation levels, cis-regulatory SNPs for DNA methylation were not observed to affect biomarker levels. We present associations between protein biomarker and DNA methylation levels at numerous loci in the genome. The associations are likely to reflect the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represent secondary effects to the pathogenesis of disease.",

    "title": "Reduced cell surface levels of GPI-linked markers in a new case with PIGG loss of function.",
    "abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid that tethers more than 150 different proteins to the cell surface. Aberrations in biosynthesis of GPI anchors cause congenital disorders of glycosylation with clinical features including intellectual disability (ID), seizures, and facial dysmorphism. Here, we present two siblings with ID, cerebellar hypoplasia, cerebellar ataxia, early-onset seizures, and minor facial dysmorphology. Using exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous nonsense variant (NM_001127178.1:c.1640G>A, p.Trp547*) in the gene Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis, Class G (PIGG) in both the patients. Variants in several other GPI anchor synthesis genes lead to a reduced expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) that can be measured by flow cytometry. No significant differences in GPI-APs could be detected in patient granulocytes, consistent with recent findings. However, fibroblasts showed a reduced global level of GPI anchors and of specific GPI-linked markers. These findings suggest that fibroblasts might be more sensitive to pathogenic variants in GPI synthesis pathway and are well suited to screen for GPI-anchor deficiencies. Based on genetic and functional evidence, we confirm that pathogenic variants in PIGG cause an ID syndrome, and we find that loss of function of PIGG is associated with GPI deficiency.",

    "title": "Detecting selection signatures in three Iranian sheep breeds.",
    "abstract": "The objective of genome mapping is to achieve valuable insight into the connection between gene variants (genotype) and observed traits (phenotype). Part of that objective is to understand the selective forces that have operated on a population. Finding links between genotype-phenotype changes makes it possible to identify selective sweeps by patterns of genetic variation and linkage disequilibrium. Based on Illumina 50KSNP chip data, two approaches, XP-EHH (cross-population extend haplotype homozygosity) and F ST (fixation index), were carried out in this research to identify selective sweeps in the genome of three Iranian local sheep breeds: Baluchi (n = 86), Lori-Bakhtiari (n = 45) and Zel (n = 45). Using both methods, 93 candidate genomic regions were identified as harboring putative selective sweeps. Bioinformatics analysis of the genomic regions showed that signatures of selection related to multiple candidate genes, such as HOXB9, HOXB13, ACAN, NPR2, TRIL, AOX1, CSF2, GHR, TNS2, SPAG8, HINT2, ALS2, AAAS, RARG, SYCP2, CAV1, PPP1R3D, PLA2G7, TTLL7 and C20orf10, that play a role in skeletal system and tail, sugar and energy metabolisms, growth, reproduction, immune and nervous system traits. Our findings indicated diverse genomic selection during the domestication of Iranian sheep breeds.",

    "title": "Exploring the β-tubulin gene family in a benzimidazole-resistant Parascaris univalens population.",
    "abstract": "Benzimidazole (BZ) drugs are frequently used to treat infections with the equine ascarid Parascaris univalens due to increasing resistance to macrocyclic lactones and pyrantel. Benzimidazole resistance is rare in ascarids in contrast to strongyle parasites where this resistance is widespread. In strongyles, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at codons 167, 198 and 200 in a β-tubulin gene have been correlated to BZ resistance, but little is known about the β-tubulin genes and their possible involvement in BZ resistance in P. univalens and other ascarids. Previously two β-tubulin genes have been identified in P. univalens. In this study, we present five additional β-tubulin genes as well as the phylogenetic relationship of all seven genes to β-tubulins of other clade III and V nematodes. In addition, the efficacy of fenbendazole for treatment of P. univalens on a Swedish stud farm was studied in 2019 and 2020 using faecal egg count reduction test. Reductions varied from 73% to 88%, indicating the presence of a resistant P. univalens population on the farm. The emergence of BZ resistance emphasizes the need for development of molecular markers for rapid and more sensitive detection of resistant populations. We therefore investigated whether possible SNPs at positions 167, 198 or 200 in any of the β-tubulin genes could be used to distinguish between resistant and susceptible P. univalens populations. Amplicon sequencing covering the mutation sites 167, 198 and 200 in all seven β-tubulin genes revealed an absence of SNPs in both resistant and susceptible populations, suggesting that the mechanism behind BZ resistance in ascarids is different from that in strongyle nematodes and the search for a molecular marker for BZ resistance in P. univalens needs to continue.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form diverse communities and are known to influence above-ground community dynamics and biodiversity. However, the multiscale patterns and drivers of AM fungal composition and diversity are still poorly understood. We sequenced DNA markers from roots and root-associated soil from Plantago lanceolata plants collected across multiple spatial scales to allow comparison of AM fungal communities among neighbouring plants, plant subpopulations, nearby plant populations, and regions. We also measured soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, and community composition of neighbouring plants and nonAM root-associated fungi. AM fungal communities were already highly dissimilar among neighbouring plants (c. 30 cm apart), albeit with a high variation in the degree of similarity at this small spatial scale. AM fungal communities were increasingly, and more consistently, dissimilar at larger spatial scales. Spatial structure and environmental drivers explained a similar percentage of the variation, from 7% to 25%. A large fraction of the variation remained unexplained, which may be a result of unmeasured environmental variables, species interactions and stochastic processes. We conclude that AM fungal communities are highly variable among nearby plants. AM fungi may therefore play a major role in maintaining small-scale variation in community dynamics and biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is an early onset refractory epilepsy typically caused by de novo heterozygous variants in SCN1A encoding the α-subunit of the neuronal sodium channel Na v1.1. The syndrome is characterized by age-related progression of seizures, cognitive decline and movement disorders. We hypothesized that the distinct neurodevelopmental features in DS are caused by the disruption of molecular pathways in Nav1.1 haploinsufficient cells resulting in perturbed neural differentiation and maturation. Here, we established DS-patient and control induced pluripotent stem cell derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC NPC) and GABAergic inter-neuronal (iPSC GABA) cells. The DS-patient iPSC GABA cells showed a shift in sodium current activation and a perturbed response to induced oxidative stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed specific dysregulations of genes for chromatin structure, mitotic progression, neural plasticity and excitability in DS-patient iPSC NPCs and DS-patient iPSC GABA cells versus controls. The transcription factors FOXM1 and E2F1, positive regulators of the disrupted pathways for histone modification and cell cycle regulation, were markedly up-regulated in DS-iPSC GABA lines. Our study highlights transcriptional changes and disrupted pathways of chromatin remodeling in Nav1.1 haploinsufficient GABAergic cells, providing a molecular framework that overlaps with that of neurodevelopmental disorders and other epilepsies.",

    "title": "Inherited DNA Repair Gene Mutations in Men with Lethal Prostate Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Germline variants in DNA repair genes are associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PrCa). The aim of this study was to characterize germline variants in DNA repair genes associated with lethal PrCa in Finnish and Swedish populations. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 122 lethal and 60 unselected PrCa cases. Among the lethal cases, a total of 16 potentially damaging protein-truncating variants in DNA repair genes were identified in 15 men (12.3%). Mutations were found in six genes with CHEK2 (4.1%) and ATM (3.3%) being most frequently mutated. Overall, the carrier rate of truncating variants in DNA repair genes among men with lethal PrCa significantly exceeded the carrier rate of 0% in 60 unselected PrCa cases (p = 0.030), and the prevalence of 1.6% (p < 0.001) and 5.4% (p = 0.040) in Swedish and Finnish population controls from the Exome Aggregation Consortium. No significant difference in carrier rate of potentially damaging nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants between lethal and unselected PrCa cases was observed (p = 0.123). We confirm that DNA repair genes are strongly associated with lethal PrCa in Sweden and Finland and highlight the importance of population-specific assessment of variants contributing to PrCa aggressiveness.",

    "abstract": "Induction of the one-carbon cycle is an early hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer metabolism. Vital intermediary steps are localized to mitochondria, but it remains unclear how one-carbon availability connects to mitochondrial function. Here, we show that the one-carbon metabolite and methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is pivotal for energy metabolism. A gradual decline in mitochondrial SAM (mitoSAM) causes hierarchical defects in fly and mouse, comprising loss of mitoSAM-dependent metabolites and impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Complex I stability and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis are directly controlled by mitoSAM levels, while other protein targets are predominantly methylated outside of the organelle before import. The mitoSAM pool follows its cytosolic production, establishing mitochondria as responsive receivers of one-carbon units. Thus, we demonstrate that cellular methylation potential is required for energy metabolism, with direct relevance for pathophysiology, aging, and cancer.",

    "abstract": "IBS shows genetic predisposition, but adequately powered gene-hunting efforts have been scarce so far. We sought to identify true IBS genetic risk factors by means of genome-wide association (GWA) and independent replication studies.\n\nWe conducted a GWA study (GWAS) of IBS in a general population sample of 11,326 Swedish twins. IBS cases (N=534) and asymptomatic controls (N=4932) were identified based on questionnaire data. Suggestive association signals were followed-up in 3511 individuals from six case-control cohorts. We sought genotype-gene expression correlations through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-expression quantitative trait loci interactions testing, and performed in silico prediction of gene function. We compared candidate gene expression by real-time qPCR in rectal mucosal biopsies of patients with IBS and controls.\n\nOne locus at 7p22.1, which includes the genes KDELR2 (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2) and GRID2IP (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2 (Grid2) interacting protein), showed consistent IBS risk effects in the index GWAS and all replication cohorts and reached p=9.31×10(-6) in a meta-analysis of all datasets. Several SNPs in this region are associated with cis effects on KDELR2 expression, and a trend for increased mucosal KDLER2 mRNA expression was observed in IBS cases compared with controls.\n\nOur results demonstrate that general population-based studies combined with analyses of patient cohorts provide good opportunities for gene discovery in IBS. The 7p22.1 and other risk signals detected in this study constitute a good starting platform for hypothesis testing in future functional investigations.",

    "title": "Low temperature, autotrophic microbial denitrification using thiosulfate or thiocyanate as electron donor.",
    "abstract": "Wastewaters generated during mining and processing of metal sulfide ores are often acidic (pH < 3) and can contain significant concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium from nitrogen based explosives. In addition, wastewaters from sulfide ore treatment plants and tailings ponds typically contain large amounts of inorganic sulfur compounds, such as thiosulfate and tetrathionate. Release of these wastewaters can lead to environmental acidification as well as an increase in nutrients (eutrophication) and compounds that are potentially toxic to humans and animals. Waters from cyanidation plants for gold extraction will often conjointly include toxic, sulfur containing thiocyanate. More stringent regulatory limits on the release of mining wastes containing compounds such as inorganic sulfur compounds, nitrate, and thiocyanate, along the need to increase production from sulfide mineral mining calls for low cost techniques to remove these pollutants under ambient temperatures (approximately 8 °C). In this study, we used both aerobic and anaerobic continuous cultures to successfully couple inorganic sulfur compound (i.e. thiosulfate and thiocyanate) oxidation for the removal of nitrogenous compounds under neutral to acidic pH at the low temperatures typical for boreal climates. Furthermore, the development of the respective microbial communities was identified over time by DNA sequencing, and found to contain a consortium including populations aligning within Flavobacterium, Thiobacillus, and Comamonadaceae lineages. This is the first study to remediate mining waste waters by coupling autotrophic thiocyanate oxidation to nitrate reduction at low temperatures and acidic pH by means of an identified microbial community.",

    "title": "Selection on accessible chromatin regions in Capsella grandiflora.",
    "abstract": "Accurate estimates of genome-wide rates and fitness effects of new mutations are essential for an improved understanding of molecular evolutionary processes. Although eukaryotic genomes generally contain a large non-coding fraction, functional non-coding regions and fitness effects of mutations in such regions are still incompletely characterized. A promising approach to characterize functional non-coding regions relies on identifying accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) tightly associated with regulatory DNA. Here, we applied this approach to identify and estimate selection on ACRs in Capsella grandiflora, a crucifer species ideal for population genomic quantification of selection due to its favourable population demography. We describe a population-wide ACR distribution based on ATAC-seq data for leaf samples of 16 individuals from a natural population. We use population genomic methods to estimate fitness effects and proportions of positively selected fixations (α) in ACRs and find that intergenic ACRs harbor a considerable fraction of weakly deleterious new mutations, as well as a significantly higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations than comparable inaccessible intergenic regions. ACRs are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and depleted of transposable element (TE) insertions, as expected if intergenic ACRs are under selection because they harbor regulatory regions. By integrating empirical identification of intergenic ACRs with analyses of eQTL and population genomic analyses of selection, we demonstrate that intergenic regulatory regions are an important source of nearly neutral mutations. These results improve our understanding of selection on non-coding regions and the role of nearly neutral mutations for evolutionary processes in outcrossing Brassicaceae species.",

    "title": "Transcriptomic changes in the plant pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG-3 in response to the antagonistic bacteria Serratia proteamaculans and Serratia plymuthica.",
    "abstract": "Improved understanding of bacterial-fungal interactions in the rhizosphere should assist in the successful application of bacteria as biological control agents against fungal pathogens of plants, providing alternatives to chemicals in sustainable agriculture. Rhizoctonia solani is an important soil-associated fungal pathogen and its chemical treatment is not feasible or economic. The genomes of the plant-associated bacteria Serratia proteamaculans S4 and Serratia plymuthica AS13 have been sequenced, revealing genetic traits that may explain their diverse plant growth promoting activities and antagonistic interactions with R. solani. To understand the functional response of this pathogen to different bacteria and to elucidate whether the molecular mechanisms that the fungus exploits involve general stress or more specific responses, we performed a global transcriptome profiling of R. solani Rhs1AP anastomosis group 3 (AG-3) during interaction with the S4 and AS13 species of Serratia using RNA-seq.\n\nApproximately 104,504 million clean 75-100 bp paired-end reads were obtained from three libraries, each in triplicate (AG3-Control, AG3-S4 and AG3-AS13). Transcriptome analysis revealed that approximately 10% of the fungal transcriptome was differentially expressed during challenge with Serratia. The numbers of S4- and AS13-specific differentially expressed genes (DEG) were 866 and 292 respectively, while there were 1035 common DEGs in the two treatment groups. Four hundred and sixty and 242 genes respectively had values of log2 fold-change > 3 and for further analyses this cut-off value was used. Functional classification of DEGs based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and on KEGG pathway annotations revealed a general shift in fungal gene expression in which genes related to xenobiotic degradation, toxin and antioxidant production, energy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and hyphal rearrangements were subjected to transcriptional regulation.\n\nThis RNA-seq profiling generated a novel dataset describing the functional response of the phytopathogen R. solani AG3 to the plant-associated Serratia bacteria S4 and AS13. Most genes were regulated in the same way in the presence of both bacterial isolates, but there were also some strain-specific responses. The findings in this study will be beneficial for further research on biological control and in depth exploration of bacterial-fungal interactions in the rhizosphere.",

    "abstract": "Dental caries and periodontitis account for a vast burden of morbidity and healthcare spending, yet their genetic basis remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we identify self-reported dental disease proxies which have similar underlying genetic contributions to clinical disease measures and then combine these in a genome-wide association study meta-analysis, identifying 47 novel and conditionally-independent risk loci for dental caries. We show that the heritability of dental caries is enriched for conserved genomic regions and partially overlapping with a range of complex traits including smoking, education, personality traits and metabolic measures. Using cardio-metabolic traits as an example in Mendelian randomization analysis, we estimate causal relationships and provide evidence suggesting that the processes contributing to dental caries may have undesirable downstream effects on health.",

    "abstract": "We report the adaptation of the INTACT method for RNA-sequencing in the endosperm and demonstrate its feasibility for allele-specific expression analysis. Tissue-specific transcriptome analyses provide important insights into the developmental programs of defined cell types. The isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types (INTACT) is a versatile method that allows to isolate highly pure nuclei from defined tissue types that can be used for several downstream applications. Here, we describe the adaptation of INTACT from endosperm nuclei for high-throughput RNA-sequencing. By analyzing the ratio of parental reads and tissue-specific gene expression in the endosperm, we could assess the contamination level of our samples. Based on this analysis, we estimate that in most of the samples the contamination level is lower than in previously published datasets. We further show that the nuclear transcriptome and total transcriptome of the endosperm are well correlated. Together, our data show that INTACT of the endosperm is a reliable methodology for endosperm-specific transcriptome analysis that overcomes the limitation of time-consuming manual endosperm dissection that is connected with high levels of maternal tissue contamination. INTACT does not rely on expensive equipment and can be set up in every standard molecular biology laboratory, making it the method of choice for future molecular studies of the endosperm.",

    "title": "Demography and mating system shape the genome-wide impact of purifying selection in Arabis alpina.",
    "abstract": "Plant mating systems have profound effects on levels and structuring of genetic variation and can affect the impact of natural selection. Although theory predicts that intermediate outcrossing rates may allow plants to prevent accumulation of deleterious alleles, few studies have empirically tested this prediction using genomic data. Here, we study the effect of mating system on purifying selection by conducting population-genomic analyses on whole-genome resequencing data from 38 European individuals of the arctic-alpine crucifer Arabis alpina We find that outcrossing and mixed-mating populations maintain genetic diversity at similar levels, whereas highly self-fertilizing Scandinavian A. alpina show a strong reduction in genetic diversity, most likely as a result of a postglacial colonization bottleneck. We further find evidence for accumulation of genetic load in highly self-fertilizing populations, whereas the genome-wide impact of purifying selection does not differ greatly between mixed-mating and outcrossing populations. Our results demonstrate that intermediate levels of outcrossing may allow efficient selection against harmful alleles, whereas demographic effects can be important for relaxed purifying selection in highly selfing populations. Thus, mating system and demography shape the impact of purifying selection on genomic variation in A. alpina These results are important for an improved understanding of the evolutionary consequences of mating system variation and the maintenance of mixed-mating strategies.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of the study was to find combinations of genetic variants significantly associated with bipolar disorder. In a previous study of bipolar disorder, combinations of three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes taken from 803 SNPs were analyzed, and four clusters of combinations were found to be significantly associated with bipolar disorder. In the present study, combinations of four SNP genotypes taken from the same 803 SNPs were analyzed, and one cluster of combinations was found to be significantly associated with bipolar disorder. Combinations from the new cluster and from the four previous clusters were identified in the genomes of 209 of the 607 patients in the study whereas none of the 1355 control participants had any of these combinations in their genome.",

    "title": "Autosomal Recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta Caused by a Novel Homozygous COL1A2 Mutation",
    "abstract": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by brittle bones and extraskeletal manifestations. The disease phenotype varies greatly. Most commonly, OI arises from monoallelic mutations in one of the two genes encoding type I collagen, COL1A1 and COL1A2 and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Here, we describe a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive OI caused by a novel homozygous glycine substitution in COL1A2, NM_000089.3: c.604G>A, p.(Gly202Ser), detected by whole-genome sequencing. The index patient is a 31-year-old Greek woman with severe skeletal fragility. She had mild short stature, low bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and blue sclerae. She had sustained multiple long bone and vertebral fractures since childhood and had been treated with bisphosphonates for several years. She also had an affected sister with similar clinical manifestations. Interestingly, the parents and one sister, all carriers of the COL1A2 glycine mutation, did not have manifestations of OI. In summary, we report on autosomal recessive OI caused by a homozygous glycine-to-serine substitution in COL1A2, leading to severe skeletal fragility. The mutation carriers lacked OI manifestations. This family further expands the complex genetic spectrum of OI and underscores the importance of genetic evaluation for correct genetic counselling.",

    "title": "Can markers of biological age predict dependency in old age?",
    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that markers of biological age, such as leukocyte telomere length (LTL), epigenetic clocks and the frailty index (FI) are predictive of mortality and age-related diseases. However, whether these markers associate with the need for care in old age, thereby having utility in reflecting dependency, is unclear. This study was undertaken to analyze whether LTL, two epigenetic clocks-the DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) and DNAm PhenoAge-and the FI are associated with the need for regular care in up to 604 individuals (aged 48-94 years) participating in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Need for regular care was defined as receiving formal or informal help in daily routines at least once per week. Logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and education was used in the analysis. The predictive accuracies, assessed as the area under the curve (AUC) for the significant biological age measures were further compared to the accuracies of the limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Neither LTL nor the epigenetic clocks were associated with the need for care, whereas the FI was; odds ratio for 10% increase in FI 3.54 (95% confidence interval 2.32-5.41). The FI also demonstrated higher predictive accuracy than the ADL score (FI AUC 0.80 vs. ADL score AUC 0.62; p < 0.001 for equality of the AUCs), whereas the difference between FI AUC (0.80) and IADL score AUC (0.75) was not significant (p = 0.238). The FI might thus be a useful marker for the need for care.",

    "title": "Paralogization and New Protein Architectures in Planctomycetes Bacteria with Complex Cell Structures.",
    "abstract": "Bacteria of the phylum Planctomycetes have a unique cell plan with an elaborate intracellular membrane system, thereby resembling eukaryotic cells. The origin and evolution of these remarkable features is debated. To study the evolutionary genomics of bacteria with complex cell architectures, we have resequenced the 9.2-Mb genome of the model organism Gemmata obscuriglobus and sequenced the 10-Mb genome of G. massiliana Soil9, the 7.9-Mb genome of CJuql4, and the 6.7-Mb genome of Tuwongella immobilis, all of which belong to the family Gemmataceae. A gene flux analysis of the Planctomycetes revealed a massive emergence of novel protein families at multiple nodes within the Gemmataceae. The expanded protein families have unique multidomain architectures composed of domains that are characteristic of prokaryotes, such as the sigma factor domain of extracytoplasmic sigma factors, and domains that have proliferated in eukaryotes, such as the WD40, leucine-rich repeat, tetratricopeptide repeat and Ser/Thr kinase domains. Proteins with identifiable domains in the Gemmataceae have longer lengths and linkers than proteins in most other bacteria, and the analyses suggest that these traits were ancestrally present in the Planctomycetales. A broad comparison of protein length distribution profiles revealed an overlap between the longest proteins in prokaryotes and the shortest proteins in eukaryotes. We conclude that the many similarities between proteins in the Planctomycetales and the eukaryotes are due to convergent evolution and that there is no strict boundary between prokaryotes and eukaryotes with regard to features such as gene paralogy, protein length, and protein domain composition patterns.",

    "title": "Trisomy and triploidy are sources of embryo mortality in the zebra finch.",
    "abstract": "Hatching failure is a surprisingly common phenomenon given that natural selection constantly works against it. In birds, an average of about 10 per cent of eggs across species fail to hatch, often owing to the death of embryos. While embryo mortality owing to inbreeding is both well-documented and evolutionarily plausible, this is not true for other sources of mortality. In fact, the basis for hatching failure in natural populations remains largely unexplained. Here, we demonstrate that embryo mortality in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) follows from chromosomal aneuploidy or polyploidy. As part of microsatellite genotyping of a captive breeding population, we found 12 individuals (3.6%) with three alleles among 331 embryos that had died during development, while there were no such cases observed among 1210 adult birds. Subsequent genotyping of 1920 single nucleotide polymorphism markers distributed across the genome in birds with three alleles at microsatellite loci, and in greater than 1000 normal birds, revealed that the aberrant karyotypes involved cases of both trisomies and triploidy. Cases of both maternally and paternally inherited trisomies resulted from non-disjunction during meiosis. Maternally inherited cases of triploidy were attributable to failure of meiosis leading to diploid eggs, while paternally inherited triploidy could have arisen either from diploid sperm or from dispermy. Our initial microsatellite screening set only had the power to detect less than 10 per cent of trisomies and by extrapolation, our data therefore tentatively suggest that trisomy might be a major cause of embryo mortality in zebra finches.",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in Nanopore sequencing chemistry has made it a promising platform for long-read 16S rRNA sequencing. This study evaluated its clinical utility in a nationwide collaboration coordinated by Genomic Medicine Sweden.\n\nThirteen mock samples comprised of various bacterial strains and an External Quality Assessment (EQA) panel from QCMD (Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics) were analysed by 20 microbiological laboratories across Sweden, using the recent v14 chemistry. Most laboratories generated full-length 16S rRNA sequencing libraries using an optimized protocol for the 16S Barcoding Kit 24, while two laboratories employed in-house PCR coupled with the Ligation Sequencing Kit. The commercial 16S bioinformatic pipeline from 1928 Diagnostics (1928-16S) was evaluated and compared with the open-sourced gms_16S pipeline that is based on the EMU classification tool (GMS-16S).\n\nSeventeen out of 20 laboratories successfully sequenced and analysed the samples. Laboratories that used sodium acetate-containing elution buffers faced compatibility issues during library construction, resulting in reduced read count. High bacterial load samples were generally well-characterized, whereas hard-to-lyse bacteria such as Gram-positive strains were detected at lower abundance. The GMS-16S tool provided improved species-level identification compared to the 1928-16S pipeline, particularly for closely related taxa within the Streptococcus and Staphylococcus genera.\n\nNanopore sequencing demonstrated promising potential for bacterial identification in a clinical setting. The results prompt further optimization of the protocol to improve detection of a broader range of species. This multicentre study highlights the feasibility of implementing Nanopore sequencing into clinical microbiological laboratories, for improved national precision diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "A temporal increase in non-B subtypes has earlier been described in Sweden by us and we hypothesized that this increased viral heterogeneity may become a hotspot for the development of more complex and unique recombinant forms (URFs) if the epidemics converge. In the present study, we performed subtyping using four automated tools and phylogenetic analysis by RAxML of pol gene sequences (n = 5246) and HIV-1 near full-length genome (HIV-NFLG) sequences (n = 104). A CD4+ T-cell decline trajectory algorithm was used to estimate time of HIV infection. Transmission clusters were identified using the family-joining method. The analysis of HIV-NFLG and pol gene described 10.6% (11/104) and 2.6% (137/5246) of the strains as URFs, respectively. An increasing trend of URFs was observed in recent years by both approaches (p = 0·0082; p < 0·0001). Transmission cluster analysis using the pol gene of all URFs identified 14 clusters with two to eight sequences. Larger transmission clusters of URFs (BF1 and 01B) were observed among MSM who mostly were sero-diagnosed in recent time. Understanding the increased appearance and transmission of URFs in recent years could have importance for public health interventions and the use of HIV-NFLG would provide better statistical support for such assessments.",

    "title": "Association of Genetic Risk Factors for Psychiatric Disorders and Traits of These Disorders in a Swedish Population Twin Sample.",
    "abstract": "Psychiatric traits associated with categorically defined psychiatric disorders are heritable and present to varying degrees in the general population. It is commonly assumed that diagnoses represent the extreme end of continuously distributed traits in the population, but this assumption has yet to be robustly tested for many psychiatric phenotypes.\n\nTo assess whether genetic risk factors associated with psychiatric disorders are also associated with continuous variation in milder population traits.\n\nThis study combined a novel twin analytic approach with polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses in a large population-based twin sample. Phenotypic and genetic data were available from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. Inpatient data were available for January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2014, and outpatient data for January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2013. The last day of follow-up was December 31, 2014. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2017, to September 30, 2017.\n\nQuestionnaires that assessed traits of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning difficulties, tic disorders (TDs), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, major depressive disorder (MDD), mania, and psychotic experiences were administered to a large Swedish twin sample. Individuals with clinical psychiatric diagnoses were identified using the Swedish National Patient Register. Joint categorical/continuous twin modeling was used to estimate genetic correlations between psychiatric diagnoses and continuous traits. The PRSs for psychiatric disorders were calculated based on independent discovery genetic data. The association between PRSs for each disorder and associated continuous traits was tested.\n\nPhenotype data were available for 13 923 twin pairs (35.1% opposite sex and 31.7% same-sex females) at 9 years of age, 5165 pairs (36.9% opposite sex and 34.0% same-sex females) at 15 years of age, and 4273 pairs (36.5% opposite sex and 34.4% same-sex females) at 18 years of age. Genetic data were available for 13 412 individuals (50.2% females). Twin genetic correlations between numerous psychiatric diagnoses and corresponding traits ranged from 0.31 to 0.69. Disorder PRSs were associated with related population traits for ASD (β [SE] = 0.04 [0.01] at 9 years of age), ADHD (β [SE] = 0.27 [0.03] at 9 years of age), TDs (β [SE] = 0.02 [0.004] at 9 years of age), OCD (β [SE] = 0.13 [0.05] at 18 years of age), anxiety (β [SE] = 0.18 [0.08] at 9 years of age; β [SE] = 0.07 [0.02] at 15 years of age; and β [SE] = 0.40 [0.17] at 18 years of age), MDD (β [SE] = 0.10 [0.03] at 9 years of age; β [SE] = 0.11 [0.02] at 15 years of age; and β [SE] = 0.41 [0.10] at 18 years of age), and schizophrenia (β [SE] = 0.02 [0.01] at 18 years of age). Polygenic risk scores for depressive symptoms were associated with MDD diagnoses (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.32).\n\nThese results suggest that genetic factors associated with psychiatric disorders are also associated with milder variation in characteristic traits throughout the general population for many psychiatric phenotypes. This study suggests that many psychiatric disorders are likely to be continuous phenotypes rather than the categorical entities currently defined in diagnostic manuals, which has strong implications for genetic research in particular.",

    "title": "Asymmetric introgression reveals the genetic architecture of a plumage trait.",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide variation in introgression rates across hybrid zones offers a powerful opportunity for studying population differentiation. One poorly understood pattern of introgression is the geographic displacement of a trait implicated in lineage divergence from genome-wide population boundaries. While difficult to interpret, this pattern can facilitate the dissection of trait genetic architecture because traits become uncoupled from their ancestral genomic background. We studied an example of trait displacement generated by the introgression of head plumage coloration from personata to alba subspecies of the white wagtail. A previous study of their hybrid zone in Siberia revealed that the geographic transition in this sexual signal that mediates assortative mating was offset from other traits and genetic markers. Here we show that head plumage is associated with two small genetic regions. Despite having a simple genetic architecture, head plumage inheritance is consistent with partial dominance and epistasis, which could contribute to its asymmetric introgression.",

    "title": "Genetic determinants of mortality. Can findings from genome-wide association studies explain variation in human mortality?",
    "abstract": "Twin studies have estimated the heritability of longevity to be approximately 20-30 %. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed a large number of determinants of morbidity, but so far, no new polymorphisms have been discovered to be associated with longevity per se in GWAS. We aim to determine whether the genetic architecture of mortality can be explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with common traits and diseases related to mortality. By extensive quality control of published GWAS we created a genetic score from 707 common SNPs associated with 125 diseases or risk factors related with overall mortality. We prospectively studied the association of the genetic score with: (1) time-to-death; (2) incidence of the first of nine major diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, diabetes, dementia, lung, breast, colon and prostate cancers) in two population-based cohorts of Dutch and Swedish individuals (N = 15,039; age range 47-99 years). During a median follow-up of 6.3 years (max 22.2 years), we observed 4,318 deaths and 2,132 incident disease events. The genetic score was significantly associated with time-to-death [hazard ratio (HR) per added risk allele = 1.003, P value = 0.006; HR 4th vs. 1st quartile = 1.103]. The association between the genetic score and incidence of major diseases was stronger (HR per added risk allele = 1.004, P value = 0.002; HR 4th vs. 1st quartile = 1.160). Associations were stronger for individuals dying at older ages. Our findings are compatible with the view of mortality as a complex and highly polygenetic trait, not easily explainable by common genetic variants related to diseases and physiological traits.",

    "title": "Genetical genomics of growth in a chicken model.",
    "abstract": "The genetics underlying body mass and growth are key to understanding a wide range of topics in biology, both evolutionary and developmental. Body mass and growth traits are affected by many genetic variants of small effect. This complicates genetic mapping of growth and body mass. Experimental intercrosses between individuals from divergent populations allows us to map naturally occurring genetic variants for selected traits, such as body mass by linkage mapping. By simultaneously measuring traits and intermediary molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, one can use integrative genomics to search for potential causative genes.\n\nIn this study, we use linkage mapping approach to map growth traits (N = 471) and liver gene expression (N = 130) in an advanced intercross of wild Red Junglefowl and domestic White Leghorn layer chickens. We find 16 loci for growth traits, and 1463 loci for liver gene expression, as measured by microarrays. Of these, the genes TRAK1, OSBPL8, YEATS4, CEP55, and PIP4K2B are identified as strong candidates for growth loci in the chicken. We also show a high degree of sex-specific gene-regulation, with almost every gene expression locus exhibiting sex-interactions. Finally, several trans-regulatory hotspots were found, one of which coincides with a major growth locus.\n\nThese findings not only serve to identify several strong candidates affecting growth, but also show how sex-specificity and local gene-regulation affect growth regulation in the chicken.",

    "abstract": "The human silencing hub (HUSH) complex binds to transcripts of LINE-1 retrotransposons (L1s) and other genomic repeats, recruiting MORC2 and other effectors to remodel chromatin. How HUSH and MORC2 operate alongside DNA methylation, a central epigenetic regulator of repeat transcription, remains largely unknown. Here we interrogate this relationship in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), a somatic model of brain development that tolerates removal of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Upon loss of MORC2 or HUSH subunit TASOR in hNPCs, L1s remain silenced by robust promoter methylation. However, genome demethylation and activation of evolutionarily-young L1s attracts MORC2 binding, and simultaneous depletion of DNMT1 and MORC2 causes massive accumulation of L1 transcripts. We identify the same mechanistic hierarchy at pericentromeric α-satellites and clustered protocadherin genes, repetitive elements important for chromosome structure and neurodevelopment respectively. Our data delineate the epigenetic control of repeats in somatic cells, with implications for understanding the vital functions of HUSH-MORC2 in hypomethylated contexts throughout human development.",

    "abstract": "The surface waters at the ultramafic ophiolitic outcrop in Chimaera, Turkey, are characterized by high pH values and high metal levels due to the percolation of fluids through areas of active serpentinization. We describe the influence of the liquid chemistry, mineralogy, and H2 and CH4 levels on the bacterial community structure in a semidry, exposed, ultramafic environment. The bacterial and archaeal community structures were monitored using Illumina sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene. At all sampling points, four phyla, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria, accounted for the majority of taxa. Members of the Chloroflexi phylum dominated low-diversity sites, whereas Proteobacteria dominated high-diversity sites. Methane, nitrogen, iron, and hydrogen oxidizers were detected as well as archaea and metal-resistant bacteria.IMPORTANCE Our study is a comprehensive microbial investigation of the Chimaera ophiolite. DNA has been extracted from 16 sites in the area and has been studied from microbial and geochemical points of view. We describe a microbial community structure that is dependent on terrestrial, serpentinization-driven abiotic H2, which is poorly studied due to the rarity of these environments on Earth.",

    "abstract": "Soil microbial diversity and community composition are shaped by various factors linked to land management, topographic position, and vegetation. To study the effects of these drivers, we characterized fungal and bacterial communities from bulk soil at four soil depths ranging from the surface to below the rooting zone of two Swedish grasslands with differing land-use histories, each including both an upper and a lower catenary position. We hypothesized that differences in plant species richness and plant functional group composition between the four study sites would drive the variation in soil microbial community composition and correlate with microbial diversity, and that microbial biomass and diversity would decrease with soil depth following a decline in resource availability. While vegetation was identified as the main driver of microbial community composition, the explained variation was significantly higher for bacteria than for fungi, and the communities differed more between grasslands than between catenary positions. Microbial biomass derived from DNA abundance decreased with depth, but diversity remained relatively stable, indicating diverse microbial communities even below the rooting zone. Finally, plant-microbial diversity correlations were significant only for specific plant and fungal functional groups, emphasizing the importance of functional interactions over general species richness.",

    "title": "Non-heritable genetics of human disease: spotlight on post-zygotic genetic variation acquired during lifetime.",
    "abstract": "The heritability of most common, multifactorial diseases is rather modest and known genetic effects account for a small part of it. The remaining portion of disease aetiology has been conventionally ascribed to environmental effects, with an unknown part being stochastic. This review focuses on recent studies highlighting stochastic events of potentially great importance in human disease-the accumulation of post-zygotic structural aberrations with age in phenotypically normal humans. These findings are in agreement with a substantial mutational load predicted to occur during lifetime within the human soma. A major consequence of these results is that the genetic profile of a single tissue collected at one time point should be used with caution as a faithful portrait of other tissues from the same subject or the same tissue throughout life. Thus, the design of studies in human genetics interrogating a single sample per subject or applying lymphoblastoid cell lines may come into question. Sporadic disorders are common in medicine. We wish to stress the non-heritable genetic variation as a potentially important factor behind the development of sporadic diseases. Moreover, associations between post-zygotic mutations, clonal cell expansions and their relation to cancer predisposition are central in this context. Post-zygotic mutations are amenable to robust examination and are likely to explain a sizable part of non-heritable disease causality, which has routinely been thought of as synonymous with environmental factors. In view of the widespread accumulation of genetic aberrations with age and strong predictions of disease risk from such analyses, studies of post-zygotic mutations may be a fruitful approach for delineation of variants that are causative for common human disorders.",
