    "title": "Ancient DNA from mastics solidifies connection between material culture and genetics of mesolithic hunter-gatherers in Scandinavia.",
    "abstract": "Human demography research in grounded on the information derived from ancient DNA and archaeology. For example, the study on the early postglacial dual-route colonisation of the Scandinavian Peninsula is largely based on associating genomic data with the early dispersal of lithic technology from the East European Plain. However, a clear connection between material culture and genetics has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that direct connection by analysing human DNA from chewed birch bark pitch mastics. These samples were discovered at Huseby Klev in western Sweden, a Mesolithic site with eastern lithic technology. We generated genome-wide data for three individuals, and show their affinity to the Scandinavian hunter-gatherers. Our samples date to 9880-9540 calBP, expanding the temporal range and distribution of the early Scandinavian genetic group. We propose that DNA from ancient mastics can be used to study environment and ecology of prehistoric populations.",

    "title": "Isotope geolocation and population genomics in Vanessa cardui: Short- and long-distance migrants are genetically undifferentiated.",
    "abstract": "The painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui is renowned for its virtually cosmopolitan distribution and the remarkable long-distance migrations as part of its annual, multigenerational migratory cycle. In winter, V. cardui individuals inhabit breeding grounds north and south of the Sahara, suggesting distinct migratory behaviors within the species as individuals migrate southward from Europe in the autumn. However, the evolutionary and ecological factors shaping these differences in migratory behavior remain largely unexplored. Here, we performed whole-genome resequencing and analyzed the hydrogen and strontium isotopes of 40 V. cardui individuals simultaneously collected in the autumn from regions both north and south of the Sahara. Our investigation revealed two main migratory groups: (i) short-distance migrants, journeying from temperate Europe to the circum-Mediterranean region and (ii) long-distance migrants, originating from Europe, crossing the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara, and reaching West Africa, covering up to over 4,000 km. Despite these stark differences in migration distance, a genome-wide analysis revealed that short- and long-distance migrants belong to a single intercontinental panmictic population extending from northern Europe to sub-Saharan Africa. Contrary to common biogeographic patterns, the Sahara is not a catalyst for population structuring in this species. No significant genetic differentiation or signs of adaptation and selection were observed between the two migratory phenotypes. Nonetheless, two individuals, who were early arrivals to West Africa covering longer migration distances, exhibited some genetic differentiation. The lack of genetic structure between short- and long-distance migrants suggests that migration distance in V. cardui is a plastic response to environmental conditions.",

    "title": "Simultaneous Ultra-Sensitive Detection of Structural and Single Nucleotide Variants Using Multiplex Droplet Digital PCR in Liquid Biopsies from Children with Medulloblastoma.",
    "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is a malignant embryonal tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) that mainly affects infants and children. Prognosis is highly variable, and molecular biomarkers for measurable residual disease (MRD) detection are lacking. Analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using broad genomic approaches, such as low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, has shown promising prognostic value. However, more sensitive methods are needed for MRD analysis. Here, we show the technical feasibility of capturing medulloblastoma-associated structural variants and point mutations simultaneously in cfDNA using multiplexed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Assay sensitivity was assessed with a dilution series of tumor in normal genomic DNA, and the limit of detection was below 100 pg of input DNA for all assays. False positive rates were zero for structural variant assays. Liquid biopsies (CSF and plasma, n = 47) were analyzed from 12 children with medulloblastoma, all with negative CSF cytology. MRD was detected in 75% (9/12) of patients overall. In CSF samples taken before or within 21 days of surgery, MRD was detected in 88% (7/8) of patients with localized disease and in one patient with the metastasized disease. Our results suggest that this approach could expand the utility of ddPCR and complement broader analyses of cfDNA for MRD detection.",

    "title": "Towards Bioleaching of a Vanadium Containing Magnetite for Metal Recovery.",
    "abstract": "Vanadium - a transition metal - is found in the ferrous-ferric mineral, magnetite. Vanadium has many industrial applications, such as in the production of high-strength low-alloy steels, and its increasing global industrial consumption requires new primary sources. Bioleaching is a biotechnological process for microbially catalyzed dissolution of minerals and wastes for metal recovery such as biogenic organic acid dissolution of bauxite residues. In this study, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to identify microorganisms in Nordic mining environments influenced by vanadium containing sources. These data identified gene sequences that aligned to the Gluconobacter genus that produce gluconic acid. Several strategies for magnetite dissolution were tested including oxidative and reductive bioleaching by acidophilic microbes along with dissimilatory reduction by Shewanella spp. that did not yield significant metal release. In addition, abiotic dissolution of the magnetite was tested with gluconic and oxalic acids, and yielded 3.99 and 81.31% iron release as a proxy for vanadium release, respectively. As a proof of principle, leaching via gluconic acid production by Gluconobacter oxydans resulted in a maximum yield of 9.8% of the available iron and 3.3% of the vanadium. Addition of an increased concentration of glucose as electron donor for gluconic acid production alone, or in combination with calcium carbonate to buffer the pH, increased the rate of iron dissolution and final vanadium recoveries. These data suggest a strategy of biogenic organic acid mediated vanadium recovery from magnetite and point the way to testing additional microbial species to optimize the recovery.",

    "title": "Genomic Impact of Whaling in North Atlantic Fin Whales.",
    "abstract": "It is generally recognized that large-scale whaling in the 19th and 20th century led to a substantial reduction of the size of many cetacean populations, particularly those of the baleen whales (Mysticeti). The impact of these operations on genomic diversity of one of the most hunted whales, the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), has remained largely unaddressed because of the paucity of adequate samples and the limitation of applicable techniques. Here, we have examined the effect of whaling on the North Atlantic fin whale based on genomes of 51 individuals from Icelandic waters, representing three temporally separated intervals, 1989, 2009 and 2018 and provide a reference genome for the species. Demographic models suggest a noticeable drop of the effective population size of the North Atlantic fin whale around a century ago. The present results suggest that the genome-wide heterozygosity is not markedly reduced and has remained comparable with other baleen whale species. Similarly, there are no signs of apparent inbreeding, as measured by the proportion of long runs of homozygosity, or of a distinctively increased mutational load, as measured by the amount of putative deleterious mutations. Compared with other baleen whales, the North Atlantic fin whale appears to be less affected by anthropogenic influences than other whales such as the North Atlantic right whale, consistent with the presence of long runs of homozygosity and higher levels of mutational load in an otherwise more heterozygous genome. Thus, genome-wide assessments of other species and populations are essential for future, more specific, conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a valuable tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity in diseases such as equine asthma (EA). This study evaluates the HIVE™ scRNA-seq method, a pico-well-based technology, for processing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from horses with EA. The HIVE method offers practical advantages, including compatibility with both field and clinical settings, as well as a gentle workflow suited for handling sensitive cells. Our results show that the major cell types in equine BAL were successfully identified; however, the proportions of T cells and macrophages deviated from cytological expectations, with macrophages being overrepresented and T cells underrepresented. Despite these limitations, the HIVE method confirmed previously identified T cell and macrophage subpopulations and defined other BAL cell subsets. However, compared to previous studies T helper subsets were less clearly defined. Additionally, consistent with previous scRNA-seq studies, the HIVE method detected fewer granulocytes and mast cells than anticipated in the total BAL samples. Nevertheless, applying the method to purified mast cells recovered an expected number of cells. A small set of eosinophils were also detected which have not been characterized in earlier studies. In summary these findings suggest that while the HIVE method shows promise for certain applications, further optimization is needed to improve the accuracy of cell type representation, particularly for granulocytes and mast cells, in BAL samples.",

    "title": "Genetic and Environmental Effects on Parent-Rated Adaptive Behaviour in Infancy.",
    "abstract": "Adaptive behaviour refers to the everyday skills that individuals are expected to have to function independently, based on their age and societal norms. Currently, we know little about the role of genetic and environmental factors in parent-rated adaptive behaviours in early infancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the aetiological factors that influence individual variability in different adaptive behaviour domains at 5 months, and the degree of genetic and environmental influences that are unique and shared across these domains. We analysed data from the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS-II) motor domain and combined domain of socialization and communication (social-communication) using a multivariate twin modelling approach. Participants were a community sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins assessed at 5 months of age (n = 594). The results show high shared environmental influence on both motor (0.67) and social-communication (0.78) domains with 45% shared variance. Both had low, but significant heritability estimates (0.21 and 0.12, respectively) but did not share genetic variance. No statistically significant associations were found between polygenic scores for autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder, and either of the adaptive behaviours measured here. Our results highlight the importance of shared environmental factors in the development of social-communication and motor skills in infancy, whether it is through social interaction with caregivers, or the stimuli and opportunities presented at home. SUMMARY: During development structural arm length representation is underestimated, while the functional arm length representation is overestimated. Underestimation of structural arm length is driven by an underestimation of hand length, as forearm length is accurate. Structural hand length is underestimated, supporting that underestimation of hand length is a characteristic of human body representation. The opposite pattern of results between structural and functional arm representation suggests the existence of multiple independent representations of the body.",

    "title": "Genomic Predictions With Nonadditive Effects Improved Estimates of Additive Effects and Predictions of Total Genetic Values in Pinus sylvestris.",
    "abstract": "Genomic selection study (GS) focusing on nonadditive genetic effects of dominance and the first order of epistatic effects, in a full-sib family population of 695 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees, was undertaken for growth and wood quality traits, using 6,344 single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) generated by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Genomic marker-based relationship matrices offer more effective modeling of nonadditive genetic effects than pedigree-based models, thus increasing the knowledge on the relevance of dominance and epistatic variation in forest tree breeding. Genomic marker-based models were compared with pedigree-based models showing a considerable dominance and epistatic variation for growth traits. Nonadditive genetic variation of epistatic nature (additive × additive) was detected for growth traits, wood density (DEN), and modulus of elasticity (MOEd) representing between 2.27 and 34.5% of the total phenotypic variance. Including dominance variance in pedigree-based Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (PBLUP) and epistatic variance in genomic-based Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) resulted in decreased narrow-sense heritability and increased broad-sense heritability for growth traits, DEN and MOEd. Higher genetic gains were reached with early GS based on total genetic values, than with conventional pedigree selection for a selection intensity of 1%. This study indicates that nonadditive genetic variance may have a significant role in the variation of selection traits of Scots pine, thus clonal deployment could be an attractive alternative for the species. Additionally, confidence in the role of nonadditive genetic effects in this breeding program should be pursued in the future, using GS.",

    "title": "Adaptive Introgression Facilitates Adaptation to High Latitudes in European Aspen (Populus tremula L.).",
    "abstract": "Understanding local adaptation has become a key research area given the ongoing climate challenge and the concomitant requirement to conserve genetic resources. Perennial plants, such as forest trees, are good models to study local adaptation given their wide geographic distribution, largely outcrossing mating systems, and demographic histories. We evaluated signatures of local adaptation in European aspen (Populus tremula) across Europe by means of whole-genome resequencing of a collection of 411 individual trees. We dissected admixture patterns between aspen lineages and observed a strong genomic mosaicism in Scandinavian trees, evidencing different colonization trajectories into the peninsula from Russia, Central and Western Europe. As a consequence of the secondary contacts between populations after the last glacial maximum, we detected an adaptive introgression event in a genome region of ∼500 kb in chromosome 10, harboring a large-effect locus that has previously been shown to contribute to adaptation to the short growing seasons characteristic of Northern Scandinavia. Demographic simulations and ancestry inference suggest an Eastern origin-probably Russian-of the adaptive Nordic allele which nowadays is present in a homozygous state at the north of Scandinavia. The strength of introgression and positive selection signatures in this region is a unique feature in the genome. Furthermore, we detected signals of balancing selection, shared across regional populations, that highlight the importance of standing variation as a primary source of alleles that facilitate local adaptation. Our results, therefore, emphasize the importance of migration-selection balance underlying the genetic architecture of key adaptive quantitative traits.",

    "abstract": "In the Boreal region, extreme seasonal variations in day-night length expose communities to dynamic light and temperature fluctuations. Freshwater bacterioplankton, representing key ecosystem components, faces climate-driven shifts; yet the fixed day-length patterns determined by latitude underscore the importance of studying light's role in predicting ecosystem responses. We investigated bacterial community composition in a brown peat bog and a clear oligotrophic lake across seasons with contrasting light regimes: the summer solstice (> 20 h of daylight) and the autumn equinox (equal day-night length). Using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA transcripts, alongside measurements of physicochemical parameters, organic matter characterisation and dissolved carbon dioxide and methane gas measurements, we found no diel cycling in the lake during either period or in the peat bog near the summer solstice. However, the structure of bacterial peat bog communities exhibited cyclic changes over diel cycles at the autumn equinox. Twelve amplicon sequence variants, including both phototrophic and heterotrophic taxa, increased in abundance at all measured morning sampling times. These findings provide valuable insights into the diel patterns of boreal lentic habitats and their bacterioplankton communities, highlighting the absence of diel fluctuations in some systems and seasons, while revealing cyclic dynamics in others, driven by conditionally rare taxa.",

    "abstract": "The painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, has the longest migration routes, the widest hostplant diversity, and one of the most complex wing patterns of any insect. Due to minimal culturing requirements, easily characterized wing pattern elements, and technical feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, V. cardui is emerging as a functional genomics model for diverse research programs. Here, we report a high-quality, annotated genome assembly of the V. cardui genome, generated using 84× coverage of PacBio long-read data, which we assembled into 205 contigs with a total length of 425.4 Mb (N50 = 10.3 Mb). The genome was very complete (single-copy complete Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs [BUSCO] 97%), with contigs assembled into presumptive chromosomes using synteny analyses. Our annotation used embryonic, larval, and pupal transcriptomes, and 20 transcriptomes across five different wing developmental stages. Gene annotations showed a high level of accuracy and completeness, with 14,437 predicted protein-coding genes. This annotated genome assembly constitutes an important resource for diverse functional genomic studies ranging from the developmental genetic basis of butterfly color pattern, to coevolution with diverse hostplants.",

    "title": "FOXO-regulated OSER1 reduces oxidative stress and extends lifespan in multiple species.",
    "abstract": "FOXO transcription factors modulate aging-related pathways and influence longevity in multiple species, but the transcriptional targets that mediate these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved FOXO target gene, Oxidative stress-responsive serine-rich protein 1 (OSER1), whose overexpression extends lifespan in silkworms, nematodes, and flies, while its depletion correspondingly shortens lifespan. In flies, overexpression of OSER1 increases resistance to oxidative stress, starvation, and heat shock, while OSER1-depleted flies are more vulnerable to these stressors. In silkworms, hydrogen peroxide both induces and is scavenged by OSER1 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of OSER1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to increased ROS production and shorter lifespan, mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased ATP production, and altered transcription of mitochondrial genes. Human proteomic analysis suggests that OSER1 plays roles in oxidative stress response, cellular senescence, and reproduction, which is consistent with the data and suggests that OSER1 could play a role in fertility in silkworms and nematodes. Human studies demonstrate that polymorphic variants in OSER1 are associated with human longevity. In summary, OSER1 is an evolutionarily conserved FOXO-regulated protein that improves resistance to oxidative stress, maintains mitochondrial functional integrity, and increases lifespan in multiple species. Additional studies will clarify the role of OSER1 as a critical effector of healthy aging.",

    "title": "Systematic screens for fertility genes essential for malaria parasite transmission reveal conserved aspects of sex in a divergent eukaryote.",
    "abstract": "Sexual reproduction in malaria parasites is essential for their transmission to mosquitoes and offers a divergent eukaryote model to understand the evolution of sex. Through a panel of genetic screens in Plasmodium berghei, we identify 348 sex and transmission-related genes and define roles for unstudied genes as putative targets for transmission-blocking interventions. The functional data provide a deeper understanding of female metabolic reprogramming, meiosis, and the axoneme. We identify a complex of a SUN domain protein (SUN1) and a putative allantoicase (ALLC1) that is essential for male fertility by linking the microtubule organizing center to the nuclear envelope and enabling mitotic spindle formation during male gametogenesis. Both proteins have orthologs in mouse testis, and the data raise the possibility of an ancient role for atypical SUN domain proteins in coupling the nucleus and axoneme. Altogether, our data provide an unbiased picture of the molecular processes that underpin malaria parasite transmission. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.",

    "title": "Temporal dynamics of woolly mammoth genome erosion prior to extinction.",
    "abstract": "A number of species have recently recovered from near-extinction. Although these species have avoided the immediate extinction threat, their long-term viability remains precarious due to the potential genetic consequences of population declines, which are poorly understood on a timescale beyond a few generations. Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) became isolated on Wrangel Island around 10,000 years ago and persisted for over 200 generations before becoming extinct around 4,000 years ago. To study the evolutionary processes leading up to the mammoths' extinction, we analyzed 21 Siberian woolly mammoth genomes. Our results show that the population recovered quickly from a severe bottleneck and remained demographically stable during the ensuing six millennia. We find that mildly deleterious mutations gradually accumulated, whereas highly deleterious mutations were purged, suggesting ongoing inbreeding depression that lasted for hundreds of generations. The time-lag between demographic and genetic recovery has wide-ranging implications for conservation management of recently bottlenecked populations.",

    "title": "A highly-contiguous genome assembly of the Eurasian spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, provides insight into a major forest pest.",
    "abstract": "Conifer-feeding bark beetles are important herbivores and decomposers in forest ecosystems. These species complete their life cycle in nutritionally poor substrates and some can kill enormous numbers of trees during population outbreaks. The Eurasian spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) can destroy >100 million m3 of spruce in a single year. We report a 236.8 Mb I. typographus genome assembly using PacBio long-read sequencing. The final phased assembly has a contig N50 of 6.65 Mb in 272 contigs and is predicted to contain 23,923 protein-coding genes. We reveal expanded gene families associated with plant cell wall degradation, including pectinases, aspartyl proteases, and glycosyl hydrolases. This genome sequence from the genus Ips provides timely resources to address questions about the evolutionary biology of the true weevils (Curculionidae), one of the most species-rich animal families. In forests of today, increasingly stressed by global warming, this draft genome may assist in developing pest control strategies to mitigate outbreaks.",

    "title": "ADAR3 modulates neuronal differentiation and regulates mRNA stability and translation.",
    "abstract": "ADAR3 is a catalytically inactive member of the family of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). Here we have investigated its function in the context of the developing mouse brain. The expression of ADAR3 gradually increases throughout embryogenesis and drops after birth. Using primary cortical neurons, we show that ADAR3 is only expressed in a subpopulation of in vitro differentiated neurons, which suggests specific functions rather than being a general regulator of ADAR editing in the brain. The analysis of the ADAR3 interactome suggested a role in mRNA stability and translation, and we show that expression of ADAR3 in a neuronal cell line that is otherwise ADAR3-negative changes the expression and stability of a large number of mRNAs. Notably, we show that ADAR3 associates with polysomes and inhibits translation. We propose that ADAR3 binds to target mRNAs and stabilizes them in non-productive polysome complexes. Interestingly, the expression of ADAR3 downregulates genes related to neuronal differentiation and inhibits neurofilament outgrowth in vitro. In summary, we propose that ADAR3 negatively regulates neuronal differentiation, and that it does so by regulating mRNA stability and translation in an editing-independent manner.",

    "title": "Gene Flow in the Müllerian Mimicry Ring of a Poisonous Papuan Songbird Clade (Pitohui; Aves).",
    "abstract": "Müllerian mimicry rings are remarkable symbiotic species assemblages in which multiple members share a similar phenotype. However, their evolutionary origin remains poorly understood. Although gene flow among species has been shown to generate mimetic patterns in some Heliconius butterflies, mimicry is believed to be due to true convergence without gene flow in many other cases. We investigated the evolutionary history of multiple members of a passerine mimicry ring in the poisonous Papuan pitohuis. Previous phylogenetic evidence indicates that the aposematic coloration shared by many, but not all, members of this genus is ancestral and has only been retained by members of the mimicry ring. Using a newly assembled genome and thousands of genomic DNA markers, we demonstrate gene flow from the hooded pitohui (Pitohui dichrous) into the southern variable pitohui (Pitohui uropygialis), consistent with shared patterns of aposematic coloration. The vicinity of putatively introgressed loci is significantly enriched for genes that are important in melanin pigment expression and toxin resistance, suggesting that gene flow may have been instrumental in the sharing of plumage patterns and toxicity. These results indicate that interspecies gene flow may be a more general mechanism in generating mimicry rings than hitherto appreciated.",

    "title": "Decoding a substantial set of samples in parallel by massive sequencing.",
    "abstract": "There has been a dramatic increase of throughput of sequenced bases in the last years but sequencing a multitude of samples in parallel has not yet developed equally. Here we present a novel strategy where the combination of two tags is used to link sequencing reads back to their origins from a pool of samples. By incorporating the tags in two steps sample-handling complexity is lowered by nearly 100 times compared to conventional indexing protocols. In addition, the method described here enables accurate identification and typing of thousands of samples in parallel. In this study the system was designed to test 4992 samples using only 122 tags. To prove the concept of the two-tagging method, the highly polymorphic 2(nd) exon of DLA-DRB1 in dogs and wolves was sequenced using the 454 GS FLX Titanium Chemistry. By requiring a minimum sequence depth of 20 reads per sample, 94% of the successfully amplified samples were genotyped. In addition, the method allowed digital detection of chimeric fragments. These results demonstrate that it is possible to sequence thousands of samples in parallel without complex pooling patterns or primer combinations. Furthermore, the method is highly scalable as only a limited number of additional tags leads to substantial increase of the sample size.",

    "title": "Novel genome reveals susceptibility of popular gamebird, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae), to climate change.",
    "abstract": "We produced a high-quality de novo genome assembly of the red-legged partridge A. rufa, the first reference genome of its genus, by utilising novel 10× Chromium technology. The estimated genome size was 1.19 Gb with an overall genome heterozygosity of 0.0022; no runs of homozygosity were observed. In total, 21,589 protein coding genes were identified and assigned to 16,772 orthologs. Of these, 201 emerged as unique to Alectoris and were enriched for positive regulation of epithelial cell migration, viral genome integration and maturation. Using PSMC analysis, we inferred a major demographic decline commencing ~140,000 years ago, consistent with forest expansion and reduction of open habitats during the Eemian interglacial. Present-day populations exhibit the historically lowest genetic diversity. Besides implications for management and conservation, this genome also promises key insights into the physiology of these birds with a view to improving poultry husbandry practices.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin modifications provide a substrate for epigenetic variation with evolutionary potential. To quantify the contribution of this layer of variation during speciation in crows, we leveraged genome and methylome sequencing data from an incipient avian species: all-black carrion crows, grey-coated hooded crows, and their hybrids. Combining controlled experimentation under common garden conditions and sampling of natural genetic variation across the hybrid zone, we show that 5mC methylation variation was largely explained by genome properties and the ontogenetic programme of the organism. Taxonomically related methylation divergence clustered in intergenic space, with the only genomic region of strongly elevated genetic differentiation encoding the diagnostic colour contrast between taxa. We conclude that methylation variation with relevance to speciation largely follows cis-genetic polymorphism in this system and does not constitute an autonomous axis of evolution.",

    "abstract": "SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with a large number of common risk gene variants, but several rare gene variants can cause monogenic SLE. The relationship between common and rare variants in SLE is unclear. We therefore investigated the occurrence of rare deleterious variants in patients with childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) and adult-onset SLE (aSLE) and compared the frequency of these variants with their individual SLE polygenic risk score (PRS).\n\nTargeted sequencing of 1832 gene regions, including coding regions of 31 genes associated with monogenic SLE, was performed in 958 patients with SLE and 1026 healthy individuals. A total of 116 patients with SLE had disease onset before the age of 18 (cSLE). An SLE common variant PRS was created from 37 SLE genome-wide association study single nucleotide variants (SNVs).\n\nRare coding deleterious SNVs (RD SNVs) were observed in 23 of the monogenic SLE-associated genes. Six per cent of patients with cSLE, compared with 3.2% of controls and 4.6% of patients with aSLE, carried rare deleterious alleles. In cSLE, RD SNVs were observed in the C1S, DDX58, IFIH1, IKZF1, RNASEH2A and C8A genes. A PRS analysis showed that patients with cSLE with any of these gene variants had a similar average PRS as control individuals.\n\nRD SNVs were observed in a small proportion of cSLE and carriers of these RD SNVs had a PRS similar to healthy individuals, suggesting the importance of rare coding heterozygous variants in driving disease risk in a subset of children with SLE.",

In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of single T helper (TH) cells from nasal polyps of patients with CRSwNP and validated these findings using multiparameter flow cytometry. Polyp tissue contained suppressive T regulatory (Treg) cells, TH2 cells, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and three transcriptionally distinct subsets of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CTL). GATA3 expression was a feature of polyp Treg cells, whereas TH2 cells highly expressed TCN1, CD200R, and HPGDS and were enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism. Only a portion of polyp TH2 cells expressed the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2, whereas a subpopulation of CD109+CRTH2- TH2 cells expressed mRNA for common inhibitor receptors including LAG3 and TIM3 and produced IL-10. Together, we resolved the complexity of TH cells in patients with CRSwNP, identifying several distinct clusters of CD4+ CTL and a population of CD109+CRTH2- TH2 cells with putative regulatory potential.",

    "title": "Comparison of spleen transcriptomes of two wild rodent species reveals differences in the immune response against Borrelia afzelii.",
    "abstract": "Different host species often differ considerably in susceptibility to a given pathogen, but the causes of such differences are rarely known. The natural hosts of the tick-transmitted bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which is one of causative agents of Lyme borreliosis in humans, include a variety of small mammals like voles and mice. Previous studies have shown that B. afzelii-infected bank voles (Myodes glareolus) have about ten times higher bacterial load than infected yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), indicating that these two species differ in resistance. In this study, we compared the immune response to B. afzelii infection in these host species by using RNA sequencing to quantify gene expression in spleen. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that several immune pathways were down-regulated in infected animals in both bank voles and yellow-necked mice. Moreover, IFNα response was up-regulated in B. afzelii-infected yellow-necked mice, while IL6 signaling and the complement pathway were down-regulated in infected bank voles; differences in regulation of these three pathways between bank voles and yellow-necked mice could thus contribute to the difference in resistance to B. afzelii between the species. This study provides knowledge of gene expression induced by a zoonotic pathogen in its natural host, and possible species-specific regulation of immune responses associated with resistance.",

    "abstract": "Immune-microbe interactions early in life influence the risk of allergies, asthma, and other inflammatory diseases. Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host's immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis-derived indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes and immunoregulation during the first months of life.",

    "title": "Identification of a SNAI1 enhancer RNA that drives cancer cell plasticity.",
    "abstract": "Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a pivotal class of enhancer-derived non-coding RNAs that drive gene expression. Here we identify the SNAI1 enhancer RNA (SNAI1e; SCREEM2) as a key activator of SNAI1 expression and a potent enforcer of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling in cancer cells. SNAI1e depletion impairs TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, in vivo extravasation, stemness, and chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer cells. SNAI1e functions as an eRNA to cis-regulate SNAI1 enhancer activity by binding to and strengthening the enrichment of the transcriptional co-activator bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) at the local enhancer. SNAI1e selectively promotes the expression of SNAI1, which encodes the EMT transcription factor SNAI1. Furthermore, we reveal that SNAI1 interacts with and anchors the inhibitory SMAD7 in the nucleus, and thereby prevents TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Our findings establish SNAI1e as a critical driver of SNAI1 expression and TGF-β-induced cell plasticity.",

    "title": "RNA-seq analysis identifies key genes enhancing hoof strength to withstand barefoot racing in Standardbred trotters.",
    "abstract": "Racing without protective shoes is common in the Swedish harness racing industry, as it can enhance horses' performance on the track. Trainers typically decide whether a horse will race barefoot based on practical experience rather than objective measures. However, this practice can sometimes lead to excessive hoof wear, posing potential welfare concerns for racing horses. Gene expression differences may help reveal the underlying genetic mechanisms associated with different phenotypic traits. To explore an objective measure for assessing which horses are best suited for barefoot racing, we conducted a polyA-selected RNA-seq experiment on tissue from the growth zone at the coronary band of the hoof. This experiment compared tissues from Standardbred trotters capable of repeatedly racing barefoot without injury (n = 11) to those that could not (n = 7). By combining stringent phenotyping with racing records and trainer interviews, we aimed to elucidate the biological factors related to hoof strength in barefoot racing, focusing on differential abundant genes.\n\nThe RNA-seq analysis identified five significantly downregulated genes in horses capable of competing barefoot across consecutive races. These genes are associated with various biological processes relevant for hoof strength: ACCS, IRX2 and TRAPPAC6A contribute to enhancing the structural integrity of the hoof; MT2A regulates its metal homeostasis and SLC35F3 likely influences local vasoconstriction in the hoof. These gene findings suggest a coordinated genetic basis for structural reinforcement and physiological support of the hoof, which may be critical for sustaining performance under barefoot conditions.\n\nOur findings suggest that the ability of Standardbred trotters to race barefoot in consecutive events is reflected in distinct gene expression patterns, underscoring a genetic basis for hoof strength. This supports further genome-wide scans aimed at identifying genetic markers for hoof durability in these horses. The focused design of our study- comparing horses that could consistently race barefoot with those that could not- enabled us to isolate a select group of genes involved in diverse aspects of hoof biology essential for quality and resilience of horse hooves. This insight could ultimately be applied to augment both the performance and wellbeing of equine athletes across disciplines.",

    "title": "CpG island methylator phenotype classification improves risk assessment in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",
    "abstract": "Current intensive treatment of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has substantial side effects, highlighting a need for novel biomarkers to improve risk stratification. Canonical biomarkers, such as genetics and immunophenotype, are largely not used in pediatric T-ALL stratification. This study aimed to validate the prognostic relevance of DNA methylation CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) risk stratification in 2 pediatric T-ALL patient cohorts: the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology (NOPHO) ALL2008 T-ALL study cohort (n = 192) and the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL-10/ALL-11 validation cohorts (n = 156). Both cohorts revealed that combining CIMP classification at diagnosis with measurable residual disease (MRD) at treatment day 29 (D29) or 33 (D33) significantly improved outcome prediction. The poor prognosis subgroup, characterized by CIMP low/D29 or D33 MRD ≥ 0.1%, had a cumulative incidence of relapse (pCIR5yr) of 29% and 23% and overall survival (pOS5yr) of 59.7% and 65.4%, in NOPHO and DCOG, respectively. Conversely, a good prognosis subgroup was also identified representing CIMP high/D29 or D33 MRD < 0.1% with pCIR5yr of 0% and 3.4% and pOS5yr of 98.2% and 94.8%, in NOPHO and DCOG, respectively. For NOPHO, MRD was also evaluated on D15, and the relapse prediction accuracy of CIMP/D29 MRD (0.79) and CIMP/D15 MRD (0.75) classification was comparable, indicating potential for earlier stratification. The evaluation of the biology behind the CIMP subgroups revealed associations with transcriptome profiles, genomic aberrations, and mitotic history, suggesting distinct routes for leukemia development. In conclusion, integrating MRD assessment with the novel CIMP biomarker has the potential to improve risk stratification in pediatric T-ALL and guide future therapeutic decisions.",

    "abstract": "Gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) induce complex galls on oaks, roses, and other plants, but the mechanism of gall induction is still unknown. Here, we take a comparative genomic approach to revealing the genetic basis of gall induction. We focus on Synergus itoensis, a species that induces galls inside oak acorns. Previous studies suggested that this species evolved the ability to initiate gall formation recently, as it is deeply nested within the genus Synergus, whose members are mostly inquilines that develop inside the galls of other species. We compared the genome of S. itoensis with that of three related Synergus inquilines to identify genomic changes associated with the origin of gall induction. We used a novel Bayesian selection analysis, which accounts for branch-specific and gene-specific selection effects, to search for signatures of selection in 7,600 single-copy orthologous genes shared by the four Synergus species. We found that the terminal branch leading to S. itoensis had more genes with a significantly elevated dN/dS ratio (positive signature genes) than the other terminal branches in the tree; the S. itoensis branch also had more genes with a significantly decreased dN/dS ratio. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that the positive signature gene set of S. itoensis, unlike those of the inquiline species, is enriched in several biological process Gene Ontology terms, the most prominent of which is \"Ovarian Follicle Cell Development.\" Our results indicate that the origin of gall induction is associated with distinct genomic changes, and provide a good starting point for further characterization of the genes involved.",

    "title": "Bladder cancer subtypes exhibit limited plasticity across different microenvironments and in metastases.",
    "abstract": "Transcriptomic and genomic analyses of bladder cancer (BC) reveal a highly diverse disease stratified into molecular subtypes with distinct molecular features and biological behaviors. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and plasticity can significantly impact diagnosis and patient management, yet their extent in BC remains highly debated. Here, we investigated whether the three main bladder cancer subtypes maintain or alter their identity in response to changes in the microenvironment and during metastatic colonization.\n\nSeven patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing the major BC subtypes were propagated into three distinct tissue microenvironments: subcutaneous, mammary fat pad and under the kidney capsule. Metastatic lesions were generated via systemic injection of tumor cells. Tumor samples were analysed using RNA- and exome sequencing, SNP-arrays and histopathology to assess subtype fidelity, genomic evolution, and clonal dynamics.\n\nA comprehensive, longitudinal multiomics analysis showed that tumors consistently maintain their molecular subtype, as well as their transcriptomic and genomic profiles, across different environments. No evidence of emerging ITH or subtype transitions was observed, regardless of the microenvironment. The transcriptomic adaptations observed in metastases and different implantation sites are limited and are associated primarily with hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion.\n\nOur results suggest that invasive bladder cancers have a strong intrinsic tumor identity that is not easily reprogrammed by the microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Iron is necessary for many neurobiological mechanisms, but its overaccumulation can be harmful. Factors triggering age-related brain iron accumulation remain largely unknown and longitudinal data are insufficient. We examined associations between brain iron load and accumulation and, blood markers of iron metabolism, cardiovascular health, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, diet), and ApoE status using longitudinal data from the IronAge study (n = 208, age = 20-79, mean follow-up time = 2.75 years). Iron in cortex and basal ganglia was estimated with magnetic resonance imaging using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Our results showed that (1) higher peripheral iron levels (i.e., composite score of blood iron markers) were related to greater iron load in the basal ganglia; (2) healthier diet was related to higher iron levels in the cortex and basal ganglia, although for the latter the association was significant only in younger adults (age = 20-39); (3) worsening cardiovascular health was related to increased iron accumulation; (4) younger ApoE ε4 carriers accumulated more iron in basal ganglia than younger non-carriers. Our results demonstrate that modifiable factors, including lifestyle, cardiovascular, and physiological ones, are linked to age-related brain iron content and accumulation, contributing novel information on potential targets for interventions in preventing brain iron-overload.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise have been associated with a range of health-related benefits, but cell type-specific adaptations within the muscle are incompletely understood. Here we use single-cell sequencing to determine the effects of exercise on cellular composition and cell type-specific processes in human skeletal muscle before and after intense exercise. Fifteen clusters originating from six different cell populations were identified. Most cell populations remained quantitatively stable after exercise, but a large transcriptional response was observed in mesenchymal, endothelial, and myogenic cells, suggesting that these cells are specifically involved in skeletal muscle remodeling. We found three subpopulations of myogenic cells characterized by different maturation stages based on the expression of markers such as PAX7, MYOD1, TNNI1, and TNNI2. Exercise accelerated the trajectory of myogenic progenitor cells towards maturation by increasing the transcriptional features of fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibers. The transcriptional regulation of these contractile elements upon differentiation was validated in vitro on primary myoblast cells. The cell type-specific adaptive mechanisms induced by exercise presented here contribute to the understanding of the skeletal muscle adaptations triggered by physical activity and may ultimately have implications for physiological and pathological processes affecting skeletal muscle, such as sarcopenia, cachexia, and glucose homeostasis.",

    "title": "On the origin of the widespread self-compatible allotetraploid Capsella bursa-pastoris (Brassicaceae).",
    "abstract": "Polyploidy, or whole-genome duplication, is a common speciation mechanism in plants. An important barrier to polyploid establishment is a lack of compatible mates. Because self-compatibility alleviates this problem, it has long been hypothesized that there should be an association between polyploidy and self-compatibility (SC), but empirical support for this prediction is mixed. Here, we investigate whether the molecular makeup of the Brassicaceae self-incompatibility (SI) system, and specifically dominance relationships among S-haplotypes mediated by small RNAs, could facilitate loss of SI in allopolyploid crucifers. We focus on the allotetraploid species Capsella bursa-pastoris, which formed ~300 kya by hybridization and whole-genome duplication involving progenitors from the lineages of Capsella orientalis and Capsella grandiflora. We conduct targeted long-read sequencing to assemble and analyze eight full-length S-locus haplotypes, representing both homeologous subgenomes of C. bursa-pastoris. We further analyze small RNA (sRNA) sequencing data from flower buds to identify candidate dominance modifiers. We find that C. orientalis-derived S-haplotypes of C. bursa-pastoris harbor truncated versions of the male SI specificity gene SCR and express a conserved sRNA-based candidate dominance modifier with a target in the C. grandiflora-derived S-haplotype. These results suggest that pollen-level dominance may have facilitated loss of SI in C. bursa-pastoris. Finally, we demonstrate that spontaneous somatic tetraploidization after a wide cross between C. orientalis and C. grandiflora can result in production of self-compatible tetraploid offspring. We discuss the implications of this finding on the mode of formation of this widespread weed.",

    "title": "Fermentative Yeast Diversity at the Northern Range Limit of Their Oak Tree Hosts.",
    "abstract": "Fermentative yeasts play important roles in both ecological and industrial processes, but their distribution and abundance in natural environments are not well understood. We investigated the diversity of yeasts at the northern range limit of their oak tree hosts (Quercus spp.) in Sweden, and identified climatic and ecological conditions governing their distribution. Yeasts were isolated from bark samples from 28 forests and identified to the species level using DNA metabarcoding. Most communities were dominated by species in the Saccharomycetaceae family, especially by species of Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces and Pichia. Each genus showed a distinct latitudinal and longitudinal distribution, and both temperature and precipitation metrics predicted significant variation in their abundance. Consistent with this, laboratory assays revealed significant effects of temperature on the growth of strains collected from different longitudes and latitudes. We found that older trees harbour more diverse and more balanced fermentative yeast communities with more evenly distributed species abundances. Communities across trees were more similar when sharing a common dominant species. This work provides a baseline for future studies on the impact of climate change on the fermentative yeast biodiversity of temperate forests in northern latitudes and contributes to a growing collection of wild isolates for potential biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "The brain, with its diverse physiology and intricate cellular organization, is the most complex organ of the mammalian body. To expand our basic understanding of the neurobiology of the brain and its diseases, we performed a comprehensive molecular dissection of 10 major brain regions and multiple subregions using a variety of transcriptomics methods and antibody-based mapping. This analysis was carried out in the human, pig, and mouse brain to allow the identification of regional expression profiles, as well as to study similarities and differences in expression levels between the three species. The resulting data have been made available in an open-access Brain Atlas resource, part of the Human Protein Atlas, to allow exploration and comparison of the expression of individual protein-coding genes in various parts of the mammalian brain.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the genetic basis underlying hepatic hemostatic gene expression variability may contribute to unraveling genetic factors contributing to thrombotic or bleeding disorders. We aimed to identify novel cis-regulatory variants involved in regulating hemostatic genes by analyzing allele-specific expression (ASE) in human liver samples.\r\n\r\nBiopsies of human liver tissue and blood were collected from adults undergoing liver surgery at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital ( n = 20). Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (gDNA) and total ribonucleic acid (RNA) were isolated. A targeted approach was used to enrich and sequence 35 hemostatic genes for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis (gDNAseq) and construct individualized genomes for transcript alignment. The allelic ratio of transcripts from targeted RNAseq was determined via ASE analysis. Public expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were used to assess novelty and importance of the ASE SNPs (and proxies, r2 ≥ 0.8) for relevant traits/diseases.\r\n\r\nSixty percent of the genes studied showed allelic imbalance across 53 SNPs. Of these, 7 SNPs were previously validated in liver eQTL studies. For 32 with eQTLs in other cell/tissue types, this is the first time genotype-specific expression is demonstrated in liver, and for 14 ASE SNPs, this is the first ever reported genotype-expression association. A total of 29 ASE SNPs were previously associated with the respective plasma protein levels and 17 ASE SNPs to other relevant GWAS traits including venous thromboembolism, coronary artery disease, and stroke.\r\n\r\nOur study provides a comprehensive ASE analysis of hemostatic genes and insights into the regulation of hemostatic genes in human liver.",

    "title": "Stop codon readthrough alters the activity of a POU/Oct transcription factor during Drosophila development.",
    "abstract": "A number of cellular processes have evolved in metazoans that increase the proteome repertoire in relation to the genome, such as alternative splicing and translation recoding. Another such process, translational stop codon readthrough (SCR), generates C-terminally extended protein isoforms in many eukaryotes, including yeast, plants, insects, and humans. While comparative genome analyses have predicted the existence of programmed SCR in many species including humans, experimental proof of its functional consequences are scarce.\n\nWe show that SCR of the Drosophila POU/Oct transcription factor Ventral veins lacking/Drifter (Vvl/Dfr) mRNA is prevalent in certain tissues in vivo, reaching a rate of 50% in the larval prothoracic gland. Phylogenetically, the C-terminal extension is conserved and harbors intrinsically disordered regions and amino acid stretches implied in transcriptional activation. Elimination of Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis changed the expression of a large number of downstream genes involved in processes such as chromatin regulation, neurogenesis, development, and immune response. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that the C-terminal extension of Vvl/Dfr is necessary for correct timing of pupariation, by increasing the capacity to regulate its target genes. The extended Vvl/Dfr isoform acts in synergy with the transcription factor Molting defective (Mld) to increase the expression and biosynthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone, thereby advancing pupariation. Consequently, late-stage larval development was prolonged and metamorphosis delayed in vvl/dfr readthrough mutants.\n\nWe demonstrate that translational recoding of a POU/Oct transcription factor takes place in a highly tissue-specific and temporally controlled manner. This dynamic and regulated recoding is necessary for normal expression of a large number of genes involved in many cellular and developmental processes. Loss of Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough negatively affects steroid hormone biosynthesis and delays larval development and progression into metamorphosis. Thus, this study demonstrates how SCR of a transcription factor can act as a developmental switch in a spatiotemporal manner, feeding into the timing of developmental transitions between different life-cycle stages.",

    "title": "Genomic differentiation tracks earth-historic isolation in an Indo-Australasian archipelagic pitta (Pittidae; Aves) complex.",
    "abstract": "Allopatric speciation has played a particularly important role in archipelagic settings where populations evolve in isolation after colonizing different islands. The Indo-Australasian island realm is an unparalleled natural laboratory of biotic diversification. Here we explore how the level of earth-historic isolation has influenced genetic differentiation across the region by investigating phylogeographic patterns in the Pitta sordida species complex.\n\nWe generated a de novo genome and compared population genomics of 29 individuals of Pitta sordida from the entire distributional range and we reconstructed phylogenetic relationship using mitogenomes, a multi-nuclear gene dataset and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found deep divergence between an eastern and a western group of taxa across Indo-Australasia. Within both groups we have identified major lineages that are geographically separated into Philippines, Borneo, western Sundaland, and New Guinea, respectively. Although these lineages are genetically well-differentiated, suggesting a long-term isolation, there are signatures of extensive gene flow within each lineage throughout the Pleistocene, despite the wide geographic range occupied by some of them. We found little evidence of hybridization or introgression among the studied taxa, but forsteni from Sulawesi makes an exception. This individual, belonging to the eastern clade, is genetically admixed between the western and eastern clades. Geographically this makes sense as Sulawesi is not far from Borneo that houses a population of hooded pittas that belongs to the western clade.\n\nWe found that geological vicariance events cannot explain the current genetic differentiation in the Pitta sordida species complex. Instead, the glacial-interglacial cycles may have played a major role therein. During glacials the sea level could be up to 120 m lower than today and land bridges formed within both the Sunda Shelf and the Sahul Shelf permitting dispersal of floral and faunal elements. The geographic distribution of hooded pittas shows the importance of overwater, \"stepping-stone\" dispersals not only to deep-sea islands, but also from one shelf to the other. The most parsimonious hypothesis is an Asian ancestral home of the Pitta sordida species complex and a colonization from west to east, probably via Wallacea.",

    "abstract": "Endometritis is an inflammatory disease that negatively influences fertility and is common in milk-producing cows. An in vitro model for bovine endometrial inflammation was used to identify enrichment of cis-acting regulatory elements in differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the genome of in vitro-cultured primary bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs) before and after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli, a key player in the development of endometritis. The enriched regulatory elements contain binding sites for transcription factors with established roles in inflammation and hypoxia including NFKB and Hif-1α. We further showed co-localization of certain enriched cis-acting regulatory motifs including ARNT, Hif-1α, and NRF1. Our results show an intriguing interplay between increased mRNA levels in LPS-treated bEECs of the mRNAs encoding the key transcription factors such as AHR, EGR2, and STAT1, whose binding sites were enriched in the DMRs. Our results demonstrate an extraordinary cis-regulatory complexity in these DMRs having binding sites for both inflammatory and hypoxia-dependent transcription factors. Obtained data using this in vitro model for bacterial-induced endometrial inflammation have provided valuable information regarding key transcription factors relevant for clinical endometritis in both cattle and humans.",

    "title": "Genetic Barriers to Historical Gene Flow between Cryptic Species of Alpine Bumblebees Revealed by Comparative Population Genomics.",
    "abstract": "Evidence is accumulating that gene flow commonly occurs between recently diverged species, despite the existence of barriers to gene flow in their genomes. However, we still know little about what regions of the genome become barriers to gene flow and how such barriers form. Here, we compare genetic differentiation across the genomes of bumblebee species living in sympatry and allopatry to reveal the potential impact of gene flow during species divergence and uncover genetic barrier loci. We first compared the genomes of the alpine bumblebee Bombus sylvicola and a previously unidentified sister species living in sympatry in the Rocky Mountains, revealing prominent islands of elevated genetic divergence in the genome that colocalize with centromeres and regions of low recombination. This same pattern is observed between the genomes of another pair of closely related species living in allopatry (B. bifarius and B. vancouverensis). Strikingly however, the genomic islands exhibit significantly elevated absolute divergence (dXY) in the sympatric, but not the allopatric, comparison indicating that they contain loci that have acted as barriers to historical gene flow in sympatry. Our results suggest that intrinsic barriers to gene flow between species may often accumulate in regions of low recombination and near centromeres through processes such as genetic hitchhiking, and that divergence in these regions is accentuated in the presence of gene flow.",

    "title": "A Single-Stranded Oligonucleotide Inhibits Toll-Like Receptor 3 Activation and Reduces Influenza A (H1N1) Infection.",
    "abstract": "The initiation of an immune response is dependent on the activation and maturation of dendritic cells after sensing pathogen associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors. However, the response needs to be balanced as excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to viral or stress-induced pattern recognition receptor signaling has been associated with severe influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here, we use an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, a single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssON) with the capacity to inhibit certain endocytic routes, or a TLR3 agonist (synthetic double-stranded RNA PolyI:C), to evaluate modulation of innate responses during H1N1 IAV infection. Since IAV utilizes cellular endocytic machinery for viral entry, we also assessed ssON's capacity to affect IAV infection. We first show that IAV infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) were unable to up-regulate the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 required for T cell activation. Exogenous TLR3 stimulation did not overcome the IAV-mediated inhibition of co-stimulatory molecule expression in MoDC. However, TLR3 stimulation using PolyI:C led to an augmented pro-inflammatory cytokine response. We reveal that ssON effectively inhibited PolyI:C-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in MoDC, notably, ssON treatment maintained an interferon response induced by IAV infection. Accordingly, RNAseq analyses revealed robust up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes in IAV cultures treated with ssON. We next measured reduced IAV production in MoDC treated with ssON and found a length requirement for its anti-viral activity, which overlapped with its capacity to inhibit uptake of PolyI:C. Hence, in cases wherein an overreacting TLR3 activation contributes to IAV pathogenesis, ssON can reduce this signaling pathway. Furthermore, concomitant treatment with ssON and IAV infection in mice resulted in maintained weight and reduced viral load in the lungs. Therefore, extracellular ssON provides a mechanism for immune regulation of TLR3-mediated responses and suppression of IAV infection in vitro and in vivo in mice.",

    "title": "Genomic Adaptations and Evolutionary History of the Extinct Scimitar-Toothed Cat, Homotherium latidens.",
    "abstract": "Homotherium was a genus of large-bodied scimitar-toothed cats, morphologically distinct from any extant felid species, that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene [1-4]. They possessed large, saber-form serrated canine teeth, powerful forelimbs, a sloping back, and an enlarged optic bulb, all of which were key characteristics for predation on Pleistocene megafauna [5]. Previous mitochondrial DNA phylogenies suggested that it was a highly divergent sister lineage to all extant cat species [6-8]. However, mitochondrial phylogenies can be misled by hybridization [9], incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or sex-biased dispersal patterns [10], which might be especially relevant for Homotherium since widespread mito-nuclear discrepancies have been uncovered in modern cats [10]. To examine the evolutionary history of Homotherium, we generated a ∼7x nuclear genome and a ∼38x exome from H. latidens using shotgun and target-capture sequencing approaches. Phylogenetic analyses reveal Homotherium as highly divergent (∼22.5 Ma) from living cat species, with no detectable signs of gene flow. Comparative genomic analyses found signatures of positive selection in several genes, including those involved in vision, cognitive function, and energy consumption, putatively consistent with diurnal activity, well-developed social behavior, and cursorial hunting [5]. Finally, we uncover relatively high levels of genetic diversity, suggesting that Homotherium may have been more abundant than the limited fossil record suggests [3, 4, 11-14]. Our findings complement and extend previous inferences from both the fossil record and initial molecular studies, enhancing our understanding of the evolution and ecology of this remarkable lineage.",

    "abstract": "Dietary lipids may influence the abundance of circulating inflammatory microbial factors. Hence, inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) induced by dietary lipids may be partly dependent on their interaction with the gut microbiota. Here, we show that mice fed lard for 11 weeks have increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and WAT inflammation and reduced insulin sensitivity compared with mice fed fish oil and that phenotypic differences between the dietary groups can be partly attributed to differences in microbiota composition. Trif(-/-) and Myd88(-/-) mice are protected against lard-induced WAT inflammation and impaired insulin sensitivity. Experiments in germ-free mice show that an interaction between gut microbiota and saturated lipids promotes WAT inflammation independent of adiposity. Finally, we demonstrate that the chemokine CCL2 contributes to microbiota-induced WAT inflammation in lard-fed mice. These results indicate that gut microbiota exacerbates metabolic inflammation through TLR signaling upon challenge with a diet rich in saturated lipids.",

    "abstract": "To date, single-cell studies of human white adipose tissue (WAT) have been based on small cohort sizes and no cellular consensus nomenclature exists. Herein, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of publicly available and newly generated single-cell, single-nucleus, and spatial transcriptomic results from human subcutaneous, omental, and perivascular WAT. Our high-resolution map is built on data from ten studies and allowed us to robustly identify >60 subpopulations of adipocytes, fibroblast and adipogenic progenitors, vascular, and immune cells. Using these results, we deconvolved spatial and bulk transcriptomic data from nine additional cohorts to provide spatial and clinical dimensions to the map. This identified cell-cell interactions as well as relationships between specific cell subtypes and insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, adipocyte volume, and lipolysis upon long-term weight changes. Altogether, our meta-map provides a rich resource defining the cellular and microarchitectural landscape of human WAT and describes the associations between specific cell types and metabolic states.",

    "title": "Genomic insights into antimicrobial resistance and virulence of E. coli in central Ethiopia: a one health approach.",
    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat causing millions of deaths annually. The study aimed to identify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and virulence genes (VGs) and track their dissemination among E. coli isolates. Seventy-seven isolates from calves, environments, and human sources were studied. The study involved WGS sequencing, bacterial strains characterized; pan genome, multi-locus sequence typing, and serotyping using O-, and H-typing. The ARGs, VGs, and MGEs were identified using ABRicate against selected respective databases. A maximum likelihood SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) tree was constructed and visualized with an interactive tree of life (IToL). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Seventy-seven of the isolates were identified as E. coli, later grouped into 5 clades and four known phylogroups. ST10 and O16:H48 were most prevalent in 12 and 42 isolates, respectively. There were about 106 unique ARGs detected between 1.3% and 91.9%, with 57 detected in 40% of isolates. In terms of ARGs, the most common were bla-ampH (90.9%), bla-AmpC1 (89.6%), tet(A) (84.4%), mdf(A) (81.8%), aph(3\")-Ib (79%), sul2 (79%), aph(6)-Id (75%), and bla-PBP (70%). It was found that 95 percent (96/106) of ARGs came from at least two sources. The majority of detected ARGs exhibited high concordance between phenotypic resistance and ARGs profiles (JSI ≥ 0.5). In eight isolates, mutations in the gyrA (3) and par-C/E (5) genes led to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid resistance. The most common co-occurrences of ARG and MGE were Tn3 with bla-TEM-105 (34), Int1 with sul1 (13), and dhfr7 (11). Meanwhile, the most frequently detected VGs (n ≥ 71 isolates) included elfA-G, fimB-I, hcpA-C, espL, ibeC, entA, fepA-C, ompA, ecpA-E, fepD, fes, and ibeB. Nearly, 88.3% (128/1450) VGs were shared in isolates from at least two sources. ETEC (53.2%), EAEC (22.1%), and STEC (14.3%) were the three most frequently predicted pathotypes. Despite significant ST diversity, ARGs and VGs showed an extensive distribution among the study groups. These findings suggest limited clonal transmission of isolates. In comparison, the wide distribution of ARGs and VGs may be attributed to horizontal gene transfer driven by similar antibiotic selection pressures in the study area.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial processes necessary for adaption to stressful host environments are potential targets for new antimicrobials. Here, we report large-scale transcriptomic analyses of 32 human bacterial pathogens grown under 11 stress conditions mimicking human host environments. The potential relevance of the in vitro stress conditions and responses is supported by comparisons with available in vivo transcriptomes of clinically important pathogens. Calculation of a probability score enables comparative cross-microbial analyses of the stress responses, revealing common and unique regulatory responses to different stresses, as well as overlapping processes participating in different stress responses. We identify conserved and species-specific 'universal stress responders', that is, genes showing altered expression in multiple stress conditions. Non-coding RNAs are involved in a substantial proportion of the responses. The data are collected in a freely available, interactive online resource (PATHOgenex).",
