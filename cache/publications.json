    "title": "NorWood: a gene expression resource for evo-devo studies of conifer wood development.",
    "abstract": "The secondary xylem of conifers is composed mainly of tracheids that differ anatomically and chemically from angiosperm xylem cells. There is currently no high-spatial-resolution data available profiling gene expression during wood formation for any coniferous species, which limits insight into tracheid development. RNA-sequencing data from replicated, high-spatial-resolution section series throughout the cambial and woody tissues of Picea abies were used to generate the NorWood.conGenIE.org web resource, which facilitates exploration of the associated gene expression profiles and co-expression networks. Integration within PlantGenIE.org enabled a comparative regulomics analysis, revealing divergent co-expression networks between P. abies and the two angiosperm species Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus tremula for the secondary cell wall (SCW) master regulator NAC Class IIB transcription factors. The SCW cellulose synthase genes (CesAs) were located in the neighbourhoods of the NAC factors in A. thaliana and P. tremula, but not in P. abies. The NorWood co-expression network enabled identification of potential SCW CesA regulators in P. abies. The NorWood web resource represents a powerful community tool for generating evo-devo insights into the divergence of wood formation between angiosperms and gymnosperms and for advancing understanding of the regulation of wood development in P. abies.",

    "title": "Growth-Inhibitory Activity of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 in Human Glioblastoma Cell Lines Is Heterogeneous and Dependent on Reduced SOX2 Expression.",
    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme continues to have a dismal prognosis. Even though detailed information on the genetic aberrations in cell signaling and cell-cycle checkpoint control is available, no effective targeted treatment has been developed. Despite the advanced molecular defects, glioblastoma cells may have remnants of normal growth-inhibitory pathways, such as the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. We have evaluated the growth-inhibitory effect of BMP4 across a broad spectrum of patient samples, using a panel of 40 human glioblastoma initiating cell (GIC) cultures. A wide range of responsiveness was observed. BMP4 sensitivity was positively correlated with a proneural mRNA expression profile, high SOX2 activity, and BMP4-dependent upregulation of genes associated with inhibition of the MAPK pathway, as demonstrated by gene set enrichment analysis. BMP4 response in sensitive cells was mediated by the canonical BMP receptor pathway involving SMAD1/5/9 phosphorylation and SMAD4 expression. SOX2 was consistently downregulated in BMP4-treated cells. Forced expression of SOX2 attenuated the BMP4 sensitivity including a reduced upregulation of MAPK-inhibitory genes, implying a functional relationship between SOX2 downregulation and sensitivity. The results show an extensive heterogeneity in BMP4 responsiveness among GICs and identify a BMP4-sensitive subgroup, in which SOX2 is a mediator of the response. IMPLICATIONS: Development of agonists targeting the BMP signaling pathway in glioblastoma is an attractive avenue toward a better treatment. Our study may help find biomarkers that predict the outcome of such treatment and enable stratification of patients.",

    "abstract": "The FADS1 and FADS2 genes in the FADS cluster encode the rate-limiting enzymes in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). Genetic variation in this region has been associated with a large number of diseases and traits many of them correlated to differences in metabolism of PUFAs. However, the causative variants leading to these associations have not been identified. Here we find that the multiallelic rs174557 located in an AluYe5 element in intron 1 of FADS1 is functional and lies within a PATZ1 binding site. The derived allele of rs174557, which is the common variant in most populations, diminishes binding of PATZ1, a transcription factor conferring allele-specific downregulation of FADS1. The PATZ1 binding site overlaps with a SP1 site. The competitive binding between the suppressive PATZ1 and the activating complex of SP1 and SREBP1c determines the enhancer activity of this region, which regulates expression of FADS1.",

    "title": "Age- and sex-specific causal effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors.",
    "abstract": "Observational studies have reported different effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors across age and sex. Since cardiovascular risk factors are enriched in obese individuals, it has not been easy to dissect the effects of adiposity from those of other risk factors. We used a Mendelian randomization approach, applying a set of 32 genetic markers to estimate the causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, glycemic indices, circulating lipid levels, and markers of inflammation and liver disease in up to 67,553 individuals. All analyses were stratified by age (cutoff 55 years of age) and sex. The genetic score was associated with BMI in both nonstratified analysis (P = 2.8 × 10(-107)) and stratified analyses (all P < 3.3 × 10(-30)). We found evidence of a causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, fasting levels of insulin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a nonstratified analysis and in the <55-year stratum. Further, we found evidence of a smaller causal effect on total cholesterol (P for difference = 0.015) in the ≥55-year stratum than in the <55-year stratum, a finding that could be explained by biology, survival bias, or differential medication. In conclusion, this study extends previous knowledge of the effects of adiposity by providing sex- and age-specific causal estimates on cardiovascular risk factors.",

    "title": "Identification of motif-based interactions between SARS-CoV-2 protein domains and human peptide ligands pinpoint antiviral targets.",
    "abstract": "The virus life cycle depends on host-virus protein-protein interactions, which often involve a disordered protein region binding to a folded protein domain. Here, we used proteomic peptide phage display (ProP-PD) to identify peptides from the intrinsically disordered regions of the human proteome that bind to folded protein domains encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Eleven folded domains of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were found to bind 281 peptides from human proteins, and affinities of 31 interactions involving eight SARS-CoV-2 protein domains were determined (KD ∼ 7-300 μM). Key specificity residues of the peptides were established for six of the interactions. Two of the peptides, binding Nsp9 and Nsp16, respectively, inhibited viral replication. Our findings demonstrate how high-throughput peptide binding screens simultaneously identify potential host-virus interactions and peptides with antiviral properties. Furthermore, the high number of low-affinity interactions suggest that overexpression of viral proteins during infection may perturb multiple cellular pathways.",

    "title": "Epoxy alcohol synthase of the rice blast fungus represents a novel subfamily of dioxygenase-cytochrome P450 fusion enzymes.",
    "abstract": "The genome of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae codes for two proteins with N-terminal dioxygenase (DOX) and C-terminal cytochrome P450 (CYP) domains, respectively. One of them, MGG_13239, was confirmed as 7,8-linoleate diol synthase by prokaryotic expression. The other recombinant protein (MGG_10859) possessed prominent 10R-DOX and epoxy alcohol synthase (EAS) activities. This enzyme, 10R-DOX-EAS, transformed 18:2n-6 sequentially to 10(R)-hydroperoxy-8(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (10R-HPODE) and to 12S(13R)-epoxy-10(R)-hydroxy-8(E)-octadecenoic acid as the end product. Oxygenation at C-10 occurred by retention of the pro-R hydrogen of C-8 of 18:2n-6, suggesting antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. Experiments with (18)O2 and (16)O2 gas confirmed that the epoxy alcohol was formed from 10R-HPODE, likely by heterolytic cleavage of the dioxygen bond with formation of P450 compound I, and subsequent intramolecular epoxidation of the 12(Z) double bond. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the cysteinyl heme ligand of the P450 domain was required for the EAS activity. Replacement of Asn(965) with Val in the conserved AsnGlnXaaGln sequence revealed that Asn(965) supported formation of the epoxy alcohol. 10R-DOX-EAS is the first member of a novel subfamily of DOX-CYP fusion proteins of devastating plant pathogens.",

    "title": "Sheep nemabiome diversity and its response to anthelmintic treatment in Swedish sheep herds.",
    "abstract": "A novel way to study the species composition and diversity of nematode parasites in livestock is to perform deep sequencing on composite samples containing a mixture of different species. Herein we describe for the first time the nematode community structures (nemabiomes) inhabiting Swedish sheep and how these are/were affected by host age and recent anthelmintic treatments.\n\nA total of 158 fecal samples were collected (n = 35 in 2007 and n = 123 in 2013-2016) and cultured from groups of sheep on 61 commercial farms in the south-central part of the country where most animals are grazed. Among the samples, 2 × 44 (56%) were paired collections from the same groups pre- and post-treatment with anthelmintics such as macrocyclic lactones, benzimidazoles or levamisole. Samples were analyzed for their nemabiome using the PacBio platform followed by bioinformatic sequence analysis with SCATA. Species richness and diversity were calculated and analyzed in R.\n\nNematode ITS2 sequences were found in all larval culture samples except two, even though the fecal egg counts were below the McMaster threshold in 20 samples. Sequencing yielded, on average, 1008 sequences per sample. In total, 16 operational taxonomical units (OTU), all with ≥ 98 % identity to sequences in the NCBI database, were recognized. The OTUs found represented nematode species of which ten are commonly associated with sheep. Multiple species were identified in all pre-anthelmintic treatment larval culture samples. No effects on nematode diversity were found in relation to host age. On the other hand, recent anthelmintic treatment lowered species richness, especially after use of ivermectin and albendazole. Interestingly, despite zero egg counts after use of levamisole, these samples still contained nematode DNA and especially H. contortus.\n\nOur findings provide evidence that nemabiome analysis combined with diversity index analysis provides an objective methodology in the study of the efficacy of anthelmintic treatment as both high and low abundant species were detected.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of cellular heterogeneity and architecture to white adipose tissue (WAT) function is poorly understood. Herein, we combined spatially resolved transcriptional profiling with single-cell RNA sequencing and image analyses to map human WAT composition and structure. This identified 18 cell classes with unique propensities to form spatially organized homo- and heterotypic clusters. Of these, three constituted mature adipocytes that were similar in size, but distinct in their spatial arrangements and transcriptional profiles. Based on marker genes, we termed these AdipoLEP, AdipoPLIN, and AdipoSAA. We confirmed, in independent datasets, that their respective gene profiles associated differently with both adipocyte and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Corroborating our observations, insulin stimulation in vivo by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp showed that only AdipoPLIN displayed a transcriptional response to insulin. Altogether, by mining this multimodal resource we identify that human WAT is composed of three classes of mature adipocytes, only one of which is insulin responsive.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the role of interspecific interactions in shaping ecological communities is one of the central goals in community ecology. In fungal communities, measuring interspecific interactions directly is challenging because these communities are composed of large numbers of species, many of which are unculturable. An indirect way of assessing the role of interspecific interactions in determining community structure is to identify the species co-occurrences that are not constrained by environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated co-occurrences among root-associated fungi, asking whether fungi co-occur more or less strongly than expected based on the environmental conditions and the host plant species examined. We generated molecular data on root-associated fungi of five plant species evenly sampled along an elevational gradient at a high arctic site. We analysed the data using a joint species distribution modelling approach that allowed us to identify those co-occurrences that could be explained by the environmental conditions and the host plant species, as well as those co-occurrences that remained unexplained and thus more probably reflect interactive associations. Our results indicate that not only negative but also positive interactions play an important role in shaping microbial communities in arctic plant roots. In particular, we found that mycorrhizal fungi are especially prone to positively co-occur with other fungal species. Our results bring new understanding to the structure of arctic interaction networks by suggesting that interactions among root-associated fungi are predominantly positive.",

    "title": "Early Pleistocene origin and extensive intra-species diversity of the extinct cave lion.",
    "abstract": "The cave lion is an extinct felid that was widespread across the Holarctic throughout the Late Pleistocene. Its closest extant relative is the lion (Panthera leo), but the timing of the divergence between these two taxa, as well as their taxonomic ranking are contentious. In this study we analyse 31 mitochondrial genome sequences from cave lion individuals that, through a combination of 14C and genetic tip dating, are estimated to be from dates extending well into the mid-Pleistocene. We identified two deeply diverged and well-supported reciprocally monophyletic mitogenome clades in the cave lion, and an additional third distinct lineage represented by a single individual. One of these clades was restricted to Beringia while the other was prevalent across western Eurasia. These observed clade distributions are in line with previous observations that Beringian and European cave lions were morphologically distinct. The divergence dates for these lineages are estimated to be far older than those between extant lions subspecies. By combining our radiocarbon tip-dates with a split time prior that takes into account the most up-to-date fossil stem calibrations, we estimated the mitochondrial DNA divergence between cave lions and lions to be 1.85 Million ya (95% 0.52- 2.91 Mya). Taken together, these results support previous hypotheses that cave lions existed as at least two subspecies during the Pleistocene, and that lions and cave lions were distinct species.",

    "abstract": "To determine the volume of tumoral and normal breast tissue containing sufficient DNA (>2 μg/sample) for genetic platforms and biobanking, with a focus on multifocality, tumoral heterogeneity, and factors that critically influence sample acceptability.\n\nWe examined 57 breast surgical specimens with multifocal (46/57) and unifocal (11/57) cancers. Punch biopsies were obtained from tissue slices under multimodal radiological guidance, and the colour-coded sampling sites were identified in large-format histology slides. The study comprised 415 DNA isolations from tumour (n = 105) and normal (n = 283) tissue, including skin (n = 27) samples. A single 2-mm core from invasive tumour contained sufficient DNA in 91.4% (96/105) of cases, depending on tumour type (3.8-108.2 μg/sample), number and size of additional foci in multifocal cases (P = 0.001), tumour consistency, and degree of necrosis. Three biopsies obtained with a 4-mm device were required from normal breast tissue, at least 10 mm from the tumour. Cold ischaemia for up to 82 min did not influence the yield of DNA.\n\nRadiological disease mapping is useful for guiding optimal specimen slicing and for targeting breast lesions. A single 2-mm core from tumour and multiple 4-mm cores from normal breast tissue yield adequate DNA in the majority of samples.",

    "title": "Genetical Genomics of Tonic Immobility in the Chicken.",
    "abstract": "Identifying the molecular mechanisms of animal behaviour is an enduring goal for researchers. Gaining insight into these mechanisms enables us to gain a greater understanding of behaviour and their genetic control. In this paper, we perform Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping of tonic immobility behaviour in an advanced intercross line between wild and domestic chickens. Genes located within the QTL interval were further investigated using global expression QTL (eQTL) mapping from hypothalamus tissue, as well as causality analysis. This identified five candidate genes, with the genes \n            PRDX4 and ACOT9 emerging as the best supported candidates. In addition, we also investigated the connection between tonic immobility, meat pH and struggling behaviour, as the two candidate genes PRDX4 and ACOT9 have previously been implicated in controlling muscle pH at slaughter. We did not find any phenotypic correlations between tonic immobility, struggling behaviour and muscle pH in a smaller additional cohort, despite these behaviours being repeatable within-test.",

    "abstract": "Upper Mesopotamia played a key role in the Neolithic Transition in Southwest Asia through marked innovations in symbolism, technology, and diet. We present 13 ancient genomes (c. 8500 to 7500 cal BCE) from Pre-Pottery Neolithic Çayönü in the Tigris basin together with bioarchaeological and material culture data. Our findings reveal that Çayönü was a genetically diverse population, carrying mixed ancestry from western and eastern Fertile Crescent, and that the community received immigrants. Our results further suggest that the community was organized along biological family lines. We document bodily interventions such as head shaping and cauterization among the individuals examined, reflecting Çayönü's cultural ingenuity. Last, we identify Upper Mesopotamia as the likely source of eastern gene flow into Neolithic Anatolia, in line with material culture evidence. We hypothesize that Upper Mesopotamia's cultural dynamism during the Neolithic Transition was the product not only of its fertile lands but also of its interregional demographic connections.",

    "title": "Functional responses of key marine bacteria to environmental change - toward genetic counselling for coastal waters.",
    "abstract": "Coastal ecosystems deteriorate globally due to human-induced stress factors, like nutrient loading and pollution. Bacteria are critical to marine ecosystems, e.g., by regulating nutrient cycles, synthesizing vitamins, or degrading pollutants, thereby providing essential ecosystem services ultimately affecting economic activities. Yet, until now bacteria are overlooked both as mediators and indicators of ecosystem health, mainly due to methodological limitations in assessing bacterial ecosystem functions. However, these limitations are largely overcome by the advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics methods for characterizing the genetics that underlie functional traits of key bacterial populations - \"key\" in providing important ecosystem services, being abundant, or by possessing high metabolic rates. It is therefore timely to analyze and define the functional responses of bacteria to human-induced effects on coastal ecosystem health. We posit that categorizing the responses of key marine bacterial populations to changes in environmental conditions through modern microbial oceanography methods will allow establishing the nascent field of genetic counselling for our coastal waters. This requires systematic field studies of linkages between functional traits of key bacterial populations and their ecosystem functions in coastal seas, complemented with systematic experimental analyses of the responses to different stressors. Research and training in environmental management along with dissemination of results and dialogue with societal actors are equally important to ensure the role of bacteria is understood as fundamentally important for coastal ecosystems. Using the responses of microorganisms as a tool to develop genetic counselling for coastal ecosystems can ultimately allow for integrating bacteria as indicators of environmental change.",

    "title": "Mapping QTL affecting a systemic sclerosis-like disorder in a cross between UCD-200 and red jungle fowl chickens.",
    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) or scleroderma is a rare, autoimmune, multi-factorial disease characterized by early microvascular alterations, inflammation, and fibrosis. Chickens from the UCD-200 line develop a hereditary SSc-like disease, showing all the hallmarks of the human disorder, which makes this line a promising model to study genetic factors underlying the disease. A backcross was generated between UCD-200 chickens and its wild ancestor - the red jungle fowl and a genome-scan was performed to identify loci affecting early (21 days of age) and late (175 days of age) ischemic lesions of the comb. A significant difference in frequency of disease was observed between sexes in the BC population, where the homogametic males were more affected than females, and there was evidence for a protective W chromosome effect. Three suggestive disease predisposing loci were mapped to chromosomes 2, 12 and 14. Three orthologues of genes implicated in human SSc are located in the QTL region on chromosome 2, TGFRB1, EXOC2-IRF4 and COL1A2, as well as CCR8, which is more generally related to immune function. IGFBP3 is also located within the QTL on chromosome 2 and earlier studies have showed increased IGFBP3 serum levels in SSc patients. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal a potential genetic association between IGFBP3 and SSc. Another gene with an immunological function, SOCS1, is located in the QTL region on chromosome 14. These results illustrate the usefulness of the UCD-200 chicken as a model of human SSc and motivate further in-depth functional studies of the implicated candidate genes.",

    "title": "Local selection signals in the genome of blue tits emphasize regulatory and neuronal evolution.",
    "abstract": "Understanding the genomic landscape of adaptation is central to understanding microevolution in wild populations. Genomic targets of selection and the underlying genomic mechanisms of adaptation can be elucidated by genome-wide scans for past selective sweeps or by scans for direct fitness associations. We sequenced and assembled 150 haplotypes of 75 blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) of a single Central European population by a linked-read technology. We used these genome data in combination with coalescent simulations (i) to estimate an historical effective population size of ~250,000, which recently declined to ~10,000, and (ii) to identify genome-wide distributed selective sweeps of beneficial variants probably originating from standing genetic variation (soft sweeps). The genes linked to these soft sweeps, but also those linked to hard sweeps based on new beneficial mutants, showed a significant enrichment for functions associated with gene expression and transcription regulation. This emphasizes the importance of regulatory evolution in the population's adaptive history. Soft sweeps were further enriched for genes related to axon and synapse development, indicating the significance of neuronal connectivity changes in the brain potentially linked to behavioural adaptations. A previous scan of heterozygosity-fitness correlations revealed a consistent negative effect on arrival date at the breeding site for a single microsatellite in the MDGA2 gene. Here, we used the haplotype structure around this microsatellite to explain the effect as a local and direct outbreeding effect of a gene involved in synapse development.",

    "title": "Convergent Evolution of Hydrogenosomes from Mitochondria by Gene Transfer and Loss.",
    "abstract": "Hydrogenosomes are H2-producing mitochondrial homologs found in some anaerobic microbial eukaryotes that provide a rare intracellular niche for H2-utilizing endosymbiotic archaea. Among ciliates, anaerobic and aerobic lineages are interspersed, demonstrating that the switch to an anaerobic lifestyle with hydrogenosomes has occurred repeatedly and independently. To investigate the molecular details of this transition, we generated genomic and transcriptomic data sets from anaerobic ciliates representing three distinct lineages. Our data demonstrate that hydrogenosomes have evolved from ancestral mitochondria in each case and reveal different degrees of independent mitochondrial genome and proteome reductive evolution, including the first example of complete mitochondrial genome loss in ciliates. Intriguingly, the FeFe-hydrogenase used for generating H2 has a unique domain structure among eukaryotes and appears to have been present, potentially through a single lateral gene transfer from an unknown donor, in the common aerobic ancestor of all three lineages. The early acquisition and retention of FeFe-hydrogenase helps to explain the facility whereby mitochondrial function can be so radically modified within this diverse and ecologically important group of microbial eukaryotes.",

    "title": "Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche.",
    "abstract": "Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.",

    "title": "SweHLA: the high confidence HLA typing bio-resource drawn from 1000 Swedish genomes.",
    "abstract": "There is a need to accurately call human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes from existing short-read sequencing data, however there is no single solution that matches the gold standard of Sanger sequenced lab typing. Here we aimed to combine results from available software programs, minimizing the biases of applied algorithm and HLA reference. The result is a robust HLA population resource for the published 1000 Swedish genomes, and a framework for future HLA interrogation. HLA 2nd-field alleles were called using four imputation and inference methods for the classical eight genes (class I: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C; class II: HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1). A high confidence population set (SweHLA) was determined using an n-1 concordance rule for class I (four software) and class II (three software) alleles. Results were compared across populations and individual programs benchmarked to SweHLA. Per gene, 875 to 988 of the 1000 samples were genotyped in SweHLA; 920 samples had at least seven loci called. While a small fraction of reference alleles were common to all software (class I = 1.9% and class II = 4.1%), this did not affect the overall call rate. Gene-level concordance was high compared to European populations (>0.83%), with COX and PGF the dominant SweHLA haplotypes. We noted that 15/18 discordant alleles (delta allele frequency >2) were previously reported as disease-associated. These differences could in part explain across-study genetic replication failures, reinforcing the need to use multiple software solutions. SweHLA demonstrates a way to use existing NGS data to generate a population resource agnostic to individual HLA software biases.",

    "title": "The importance of the ZBED6-IGF2 axis for metabolic regulation in mouse myoblast cells.",
    "abstract": "The transcription factor ZBED6 acts as a repressor of Igf2 and affects directly or indirectly the transcriptional regulation of thousands of genes. Here, we use gene editing in mouse C2C12 myoblasts and show that ZBED6 regulates Igf2 exclusively through its binding site 5'-GGCTCG-3' in intron 1 of Igf2. Deletion of this motif (Igf2ΔGGCT ) or complete ablation of Zbed6 leads to ~20-fold upregulation of the IGF2 protein. Quantitative proteomics revealed an activation of Ras signaling pathway in both Zbed6-/- and Igf2ΔGGCT myoblasts, and a significant enrichment of mitochondrial membrane proteins among proteins showing altered expression in Zbed6-/- myoblasts. Both Zbed6-/- and Igf2ΔGGCT myoblasts showed a faster growth rate and developed myotube hypertrophy. These cells exhibited an increased O2 consumption rate, due to IGF2 upregulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed ~30% overlap between differentially expressed genes in Zbed6-/- and Igf2ΔGGCT myotubes, with an enrichment of upregulated genes involved in muscle development. In contrast, ZBED6-overexpression in myoblasts led to cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, reduced mitochondrial activities, and ceased myoblast differentiation. The similarities in growth and differentiation phenotypes observed in Zbed6-/- and Igf2ΔGGCT myoblasts demonstrates that ZBED6 affects mitochondrial activity and myogenesis largely through its regulation of IGF2 expression. This study adds new insights how the ZBED6-Igf2 axis affects muscle metabolism.",

    "title": "A regulatory role for CHD2 in myelopoiesis.",
    "abstract": "The transcriptional program that dictates haematopoietic cell fate and differentiation requires an epigenetic regulatory and memory function, provided by a network of epigenetic factors that regulate DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications and chromatin structure. Disturbed epigenetic regulation causes perturbations in the blood cell differentiation program that results in various types of haematopoietic disorders. Thus, accurate epigenetic regulation is essential for functional haematopoiesis. In this study, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach to identify new epigenetic regulators in myeloid differentiation. We designed a Chromatin-UMI CRISPR guide library targeting 1092 epigenetic regulators. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of the chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line K-562 was used as a megakaryocytic myeloid differentiation model. Both previously described developmental epigenetic regulators and novel factors were identified in our screen. In this study, we validated and characterized a role for the chromatin remodeller CHD2 in myeloid proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation.",

    "title": "31° South: The physiology of adaptation to arid conditions in a passerine bird.",
    "abstract": "Arid environments provide ideal ground for investigating the mechanisms of adaptive evolution. High temperatures and low water availability are relentless stressors for many endotherms, including birds; yet birds persist in deserts. While physiological adaptation probably involves metabolic phenotypes, the underlying mechanisms (plasticity, genetics) are largely uncharacterized. To explore this, we took an intraspecific approach that focused on a species that is resident over a mesic to arid gradient, the Karoo scrub-robin (Cercotrichas coryphaeus). Specifically, we integrated environmental (climatic and primary productivity), physiological (metabolic rates: a measure of energy expenditure), genotypic (genetic variation underlying the machinery of energy production) and microbiome (involved in processing food from where energy is retrieved) data, to infer the mechanism of physiological adaptation. We that found the variation in energetic physiology phenotypes and gut microbiome composition are associated with environmental features as well as with variation in genes underlying energy metabolic pathways. Specifically, we identified a small list of candidate adaptive genes, some of them with known ties to relevant physiology phenotypes. Together our results suggest that selective pressures on energetic physiology mediated by genes related to energy homeostasis and possibly microbiota composition may facilitate adaptation to local conditions and provide an explanation to the high avian intraspecific divergence observed in harsh environments.",

    "title": "Colitis Induces Sex-Specific Intestinal Transcriptomic Responses in Mice.",
    "abstract": "There are significant sex differences in colorectal cancer (CRC), including in incidence, onset, and molecular characteristics. Further, while inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for CRC in both sexes, men with IBD have a 60% higher risk of developing CRC compared to women. In this study, we investigated sex differences during colitis-associated CRC (CAC) using a chemically induced CAC mouse model. The mice were treated with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and followed for 9 and 15 weeks. We performed RNA-sequencing of colon samples from males (n = 15) and females (n = 15) to study different stages of inflammation and identify corresponding transcriptomic sex differences in non-tumor colon tissue. We found a significant transcriptome response to AOM/DSS treatment in both sexes, including in pathways related to inflammation and cell proliferation. Notably, we found a stronger response in males and that male-specific differentially expressed genes were involved in NFκB signaling and circadian rhythm. Further, an overrepresented proportion of male-specific gene regulations were predicted to be targets of Stat3, whereas for females, targets of the glucocorticoid receptor (Gr/Nr3c1) were overrepresented. At 15 weeks, the most apparent sex difference involved genes with functions in T cell proliferation, followed by the regulation of demethylases. The majority of sex differences were thus related to inflammation and the immune system. Our novel data, profiling the transcriptomic response to chemically induced colitis and CAC, indicate clear sex differences in CRC initiation and progression.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors explain a major proportion of human height variation, but differences in mean stature have also been found between socio-economic categories suggesting a possible effect of environment. By utilizing a classical twin design which allows decomposing the variation of height into genetic and environmental components, we tested the hypothesis that environmental variation in height is greater in offspring of lower educated parents. Twin data from 29 cohorts including 65,978 complete twin pairs with information on height at ages 1 to 69 years and on parental education were pooled allowing the analyses at different ages and in three geographic-cultural regions (Europe, North America and Australia, and East Asia). Parental education mostly showed a positive association with offspring height, with significant associations in mid-childhood and from adolescence onwards. In variance decomposition modeling, the genetic and environmental variance components of height did not show a consistent relation to parental education. A random-effects meta-regression analysis of the aggregate-level data showed a trend towards greater shared environmental variation of height in low parental education families. In conclusion, in our very large dataset from twin cohorts around the globe, these results provide only weak evidence for the study hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection and the ornaments that inform such choices have been extensively studied, particularly from a phenotypic perspective. Although more is being revealed about the genetic architecture of sexual ornaments, much still remains to be discovered. The comb of the chicken is one of the most widely recognized sexual ornaments, which has been shown to be correlated with both fecundity and bone allocation. In this study, we use a combination of multiple intercrosses between White Leghorn populations and wild-derived Red Junglefowl to, first, map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for bone allocation and, second, to identify expression QTL that correlate and colocalize with comb mass. These candidate quantitative genes were then assessed for potential pleiotropic effects on bone tissue and fecundity traits. We identify genes that correlate with both relative comb mass and bone traits suggesting a combination of both pleiotropy and linkage mediates gene regulatory variation in these traits.",

    "title": "ADAR1- and ADAR2-mediated regulation of maturation and targeting of miR-376b to modulate GABA neurotransmitter catabolism.",
    "abstract": "miRNAs are short noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation or inducing degradation of target mRNAs. miRNAs are often expressed as polycistronic transcripts, so-called miRNA clusters, containing several miRNA precursors. The largest mammalian miRNA cluster, the miR-379-410 cluster, is expressed primarily during embryonic development and in the adult brain; however, downstream regulation of this cluster is not well understood. Here, we investigated adenosine deamination to inosine (RNA editing) in the miR-379-410 cluster by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes as a possible mechanism modulating the expression and activity of these miRNAs in a brain-specific manner. We show that the levels of editing in the majority of mature miRNAs are lower than the editing levels of the corresponding site in primary miRNA precursors. However, for one miRNA, miR-376b-3p, editing was significantly higher in the mature form than in the primary precursor. We found miR-376b-3p maturation is negatively regulated by ADAR2 in an editing activity-independent manner, whereas ADAR1-mediated and ADAR2-mediated editing were observed to be competitive. In addition, the edited miR-376b-3p targets a different set of mRNAs than unedited miR-376b-3p, including 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, encoding the enzyme responsible for the catabolism of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Expression of edited miR-376b-3p led to increased intracellular GABA levels as well as increased cell surface presentation of GABA type A receptors. Our results indicate that both editing and editing-independent effects modulate the expression of miR-376b-3p, with the potential to regulate GABAergic signaling in the brain.",

    "title": "Population genomics reveals lack of greater white-fronted introgression into the Swedish lesser white-fronted goose.",
    "abstract": "Interspecific introgression is considered a potential threat to endangered taxa. One example where this has had a major impact on conservation policy is the lesser white-fronted goose (LWfG). After a dramatic decline in Sweden, captive breeding birds were released between 1981-1999 with the aim to reinforce the population. However, the detection of greater white-fronted goose (GWfG) mitochondrial DNA in the LWfG breeding stock led to the release program being dismantled, even though the presence of GWfG introgression in the actual wild Swedish LWfG population was never documented. To examine this, we sequenced the complete genomes of 21 LWfG birds from the Swedish, Russian and Norwegian populations, and compared these with genomes from other goose species, including the GWfG. We found no evidence of interspecific introgression into the wild Swedish LWfG population in either nuclear genomic or mitochondrial data. Moreover, Swedish LWfG birds are genetically distinct from the Russian and Norwegian populations and display comparatively low genomic diversity and high levels of inbreeding. Our findings highlight the utility of genomic approaches in providing scientific evidence that can help improve conservation management as well as policies for breeding and reinforcement programmes.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation of xylem elements involves cell expansion, secondary cell wall (SCW) deposition and programmed cell death. Transitions between these phases require strict spatiotemporal control. The function of Populus ERF139 (Potri.013G101100) in xylem differentiation was characterized in transgenic overexpression and dominant repressor lines of ERF139 in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × tremuloides). Xylem properties, SCW chemistry and downstream targets were analyzed in both types of transgenic trees using microscopy techniques, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, wet chemistry methods and RNA sequencing. Opposite phenotypes were observed in the secondary xylem vessel sizes and SCW chemistry in the two different types of transgenic trees, supporting the function of ERF139 in suppressing the radial expansion of vessel elements and stimulating accumulation of guaiacyl-type lignin and possibly also xylan. Comparative transcriptomics identified genes related to SCW biosynthesis (LAC5, LBD15, MYB86) and salt and drought stress-responsive genes (ANAC002, ABA1) as potential direct targets of ERF139. The phenotypes of the transgenic trees and the stem expression profiles of ERF139 potential target genes support the role of ERF139 as a transcriptional regulator of xylem cell expansion and SCW formation, possibly in response to osmotic changes of the cells.",

    "abstract": "Certain strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens can colonize plants and improve growth and stress management. In order to study these effects, bacterial growth dynamics on plants and in the rhizosphere are of interest calling for specific analytical tools. For that purpose, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays were developed in order to differentiate among three closely related B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strains (UCMB5033, UCMB5036, UCMB5113) and to determine their levels with high accuracy. Oligonucleotide primers were designed for strain unique gene sequences and used for SYBR green based qPCR analysis. Standard curves covered a wide linear range (10(6)) of DNA amounts with the lowest detection level at 50 fg. Post-reaction melting curve analysis showed only a single product. Accurate threshold cycles were obtained, even in the presence of high excess of related Bacillus strains and total bacterial DNA from soil. Analysis of Bacillus colonisation after seed treatment of two oilseed rape cultivars (Oase and Ritz) grown on agar support showed a time dependent effect but that the bacteria mostly were found on root tissues and little on green tissues. The colonisation on plants grown in soil varied among the Bacillus strains where Oase seemed to house more bacteria than Ritz. Applied as a mixture, all three Bacillus strains co-existed on the roots of plants grown in soil. The qPCR assay in combination with other techniques will be a powerful tool to study plant interactions of these B. amyloliquefaciens biocontrol agents to further understand the requirements for successful interactions and improvement of plant properties.",

    "title": "LPS-treatment of bovine endometrial epithelial cells causes differential DNA methylation of genes associated with inflammation and endometrial function.",
    "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin stimulates pro-inflammatory pathways and is a key player in the pathological mechanisms involved in the development of endometritis. This study aimed to investigate LPS-induced DNA methylation changes in bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs), which may affect endometrial function. Following in vitro culture, bEECs from three cows were either untreated (0) or exposed to 2 and 8 μg/mL LPS for 24 h.\n\nDNA samples extracted at 0 h and 24 h were sequenced using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). When comparing DNA methylation results at 24 h to time 0 h, a larger proportion of hypomethylated regions were identified in the LPS-treated groups, whereas the trend was opposite in controls. When comparing LPS groups to controls at 24 h, a total of 1291 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified (55% hypomethylated and 45% hypermethylated). Integration of DNA methylation data obtained here with our previously published gene expression data obtained from the same samples showed a negative correlation (r = - 0.41 for gene promoter, r = - 0.22 for gene body regions, p < 0.05). Differential methylation analysis revealed that effects of LPS treatment were associated with methylation changes for genes involved in regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, and external stimuli. Gene ontology and pathway analyses showed that most of the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were associated with cell proliferation and apoptotic processes; and pathways such as calcium-, oxytocin- and MAPK-signaling pathways with recognized roles in innate immunity. Several DMGs were related to systemic inflammation and tissue re-modelling including HDAC4, IRAK1, AKT1, MAP3K6, Wnt7A and ADAMTS17.\n\nThe present results show that LPS altered the DNA methylation patterns of bovine endometrial epithelial cells. This information, combined with our previously reported changes in gene expression related to endometrial function, confirm that LPS activates pro-inflammatory mechanisms leading to perturbed immune balance and cell adhesion processes in the endometrium.",

    "title": "Niche partitioning between planktivorous fish in the pelagic Baltic Sea assessed by DNA metabarcoding, qPCR and microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Marine communities undergo rapid changes related to human-induced ecosystem pressures. The Baltic Sea pelagic food web has experienced several regime shifts during the past century, resulting in a system where competition between the dominant planktivorous mesopredatory clupeid fish species herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and the rapidly increasing stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) population is assumed to be high. Here, we investigate diet overlap between these three planktivorous fishes in the Baltic Sea, utilizing DNA metabarcoding on the 18S rRNA gene and the COI gene, targeted qPCR, and microscopy. Our results show niche differentiation between clupeids and stickleback, and highlight that rotifers play an important role in this pattern, as a resource that is not being used by the clupeids nor by other zooplankton in spring. We further show that all the diet assessment methods used in this study are consistent, but also that DNA metabarcoding describes the plankton-fish link at the highest taxonomic resolution. This study suggests that rotifers and other understudied soft-bodied prey may have an important function in the pelagic food web and that the growing population of pelagic stickleback may be supported by the open feeding niche offered by the rotifers.",

    "title": "Saturation mutagenesis charts the functional landscape of Salmonella ProQ and reveals a gene regulatory function of its C-terminal domain.",
    "abstract": "The global RNA-binding protein ProQ has emerged as a central player in post-transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria. While the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ProQ harbors the major RNA-binding activity, the role of the ProQ C-terminal domain (CTD) has remained unclear. Here, we have applied saturation mutagenesis coupled to phenotypic sorting and long-read sequencing to chart the regulatory capacity of Salmonella ProQ. Parallel monitoring of thousands of ProQ mutants allowed mapping of critical residues in both the NTD and the CTD, while the linker separating these domains was tolerant to mutations. Single amino acid substitutions in the NTD associated with abolished regulatory capacity strongly align with RNA-binding deficiency. An observed cellular instability of ProQ associated with mutations in the NTD suggests that interaction with RNA protects ProQ from degradation. Mutation of conserved CTD residues led to overstabilization of RNA targets and rendered ProQ inert in regulation, without affecting protein stability in vivo. Furthermore, ProQ lacking the CTD, although binding competent, failed to protect an mRNA target from degradation. Together, our data provide a comprehensive overview of residues important for ProQ-dependent regulation and reveal an essential role for the enigmatic ProQ CTD in gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Arrest of oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and remyelination following myelin damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with neurodegeneration and clinical worsening. We show that Glutathione S-transferase 4α (Gsta4) is highly expressed during adult OL differentiation and that Gsta4 loss impairs differentiation into myelinating OLs in vitro. In addition, we identify Gsta4 as a target of both dimethyl fumarate, an existing MS therapy, and clemastine fumarate, a candidate remyelinating agent in MS. Overexpression of Gsta4 reduces expression of Fas and activity of the mitochondria-associated Casp8-Bid-axis in adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells, leading to improved OL survival during differentiation. The Gsta4 effect on apoptosis during adult OL differentiation was corroborated in vivo in both lysolecithin-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, where Casp8 activity was reduced in Gsta4-overexpressing OLs. Our results identify Gsta4 as an intrinsic regulator of OL differentiation, survival and remyelination, as well as a potential target for future reparative MS therapies.",

    "title": "Marine Sediments Illuminate Chlamydiae Diversity and Evolution.",
    "abstract": "The bacterial phylum Chlamydiae is so far composed of obligate symbionts of eukaryotic hosts. Well known for Chlamydiaceae, pathogens of humans and other animals, Chlamydiae also include so-called environmental lineages that primarily infect microbial eukaryotes. Environmental surveys indicate that Chlamydiae are found in a wider range of environments than anticipated previously. However, the vast majority of this chlamydial diversity has been underexplored, biasing our current understanding of their biology, ecological importance, and evolution. Here, we report that previously undetected and active chlamydial lineages dominate microbial communities in deep anoxic marine sediments taken from the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. Reaching relative abundances of up to 43% of the bacterial community, and a maximum diversity of 163 different species-level taxonomic units, these Chlamydiae represent important community members. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we reconstructed 24 draft chlamydial genomes, expanding by over a third the known genomic diversity in this phylum. Phylogenomic analyses revealed several novel clades across the phylum, including a previously unknown sister lineage of the Chlamydiaceae, providing new insights into the origin of pathogenicity in this family. We were unable to identify putative eukaryotic hosts for these marine sediment chlamydiae, despite identifying genomic features that may be indicative of host-association. The high abundance and genomic diversity of Chlamydiae in these anoxic marine sediments indicate that some members could play an important, and thus far overlooked, ecological role in such environments and may indicate alternate lifestyle strategies.",

    "abstract": "Halophytophthora species have been traditionally regarded as brackish water oomycetes; however, recent reports in inland freshwater call for a better understanding of their ecology and possible pathogenicity. We studied the distribution of Halophytophthora fluviatilis in 117 forest streams by metabarcoding river filtrates taken in spring and autumn and by direct isolation from floating leaves. Pathogenicity on six Fagaceae species and Alnus glutinosa was assessed by stem inoculations. The distribution of H. fluviatilis was correlated with high mean annual temperatures (>93.5% of reports in Ta > 12.2 °C) and low precipitation records. H. fluviatilis was therefore widely distributed in forest streams in a warm-dry climate, but it was mostly absent in subalpine streams. H. fluviatilis was primarily detected in autumn with few findings in spring (28.4% vs. 2.7% of streams). H. fluviatilis was able to cause small lesions on some tree species such as Quercus pubescens, Q. suber and A. glutinosa. Our findings suggest that H. fluviatilis may be adapted to warm and dry conditions, and that it does not pose a significant threat to the most common Mediterranean broadleaved trees.",

    "abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and nephritis in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are two common forms of glomerulonephritis in which genetic findings are of importance for disease development. We have recently reported an association of IgAN with variants of TGFB1. In several autoimmune diseases, particularly in SLE, IRF5, STAT4 genes and TRAF1-C5 locus have been shown to be important candidate genes. The aim of this study was to compare genetic variants from the TGFB1, IRF5, STAT4 genes and TRAF1-C5 locus with susceptibility to IgAN and lupus nephritis in two Swedish cohorts.\n\nWe genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genetic loci in 1252 DNA samples from patients with biopsy proven IgAN or with SLE (with and without nephritis) and healthy age- and sex-matched controls from the same population in Sweden.\n\nGenotype and allelic frequencies for SNPs from selected genes did not differ significantly between lupus nephritis patients and SLE patients without nephritis. In addition, haplotype analysis for seven selected SNPs did not reveal a difference for the SLE patient groups with and without nephritis. Moreover, none of these SPNs showed a significant difference between IgAN patients and healthy controls. IRF5 and STAT4 variants remained significantly different between SLE cases and healthy controls. In addition, the data did not show an association of TRAF1-C5 polymorphism with susceptibility to SLE in this Swedish population.\n\nOur data do not support an overlap in genetic susceptibility between patients with IgAN or SLE and reveal no specific importance of SLE associated SNPs for the presence of lupus nephritis.",

    "title": "Whole-genome sequencing of human remains to enable genealogy DNA database searches - A case report.",
    "abstract": "Recently a number of high profile crime cases (e.g. the \"Golden State Killer\") have successfully been solved or given new leads with the use of genome wide DNA data in combination with pairwise matching from individuals present in genealogy DNA databases. Such databases will primarily involve distant relatives which in turn require a large amount of genetic information, in the range of several hundred thousand to millions of SNPs, to be genotyped. While it nowadays is fairly straightforward to obtain such as data from high quality and high quantity DNA, it is still a challenge for degraded DNA of low quantity such in the case of forensic samples. Here we present a successful effort in obtaining genome-wide genotype data from human remains. The goal was to get investigative leads in order to identify the remains of an unknown male (\"the Ekeby man\") that was found murdered in the south of Sweden in 2003. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA originating from a bone sample. Three replicates of libraries were prepared using ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit (Takara) which were sequenced on a HiSeq X instrument (Illumina). A mean coverage of 30X was obtained when the sequencing reads were mapped to a human reference genome. Following further bioinformatic processing, allele calling, quality checks and filtering to match the genealogy DNA database SNPs, genotypes for approximately one million SNPs were established. The resulting SNP genotypes were then used to search for relatives in the genealogy DNA database GEDmatch (www.gedmatch.com). A candidate list of relatives was obtained which was further processed using traditional genealogy methods in order to get leads about the identity of the unknown. In summary, this report shows how whole-genome sequencing successfully can be applied on forensic samples to create the SNP genotypes required for searches in genealogy DNA databases for the purpose of generating leads to identify missing or unknown persons, including perpetrators and victims.",

    "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hESC-RPE) are a promising cell source to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Despite several ongoing clinical studies, a detailed mapping of transient cellular states during in vitro differentiation has not been performed. Here, we conduct single-cell transcriptomic profiling of an hESC-RPE differentiation protocol that has been developed for clinical use. Differentiation progressed through a culture diversification recapitulating early embryonic development, whereby cells rapidly acquired a rostral embryo patterning signature before converging toward the RPE lineage. At intermediate steps, we identified and examined the potency of an NCAM1+ retinal progenitor population and showed the ability of the protocol to suppress non-RPE fates. We demonstrated that the method produces a pure RPE pool capable of maturing further after subretinal transplantation in a large-eyed animal model. Our evaluation of hESC-RPE differentiation supports the development of safe and efficient pluripotent stem cell-based therapies for AMD.",

    "title": "The miRNome function transitions from regulating developmental genes to transposable elements during pollen maturation.",
    "abstract": "Animal and plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for the spatio-temporal regulation of development. Together with this role, plant miRNAs have been proposed to target transposable elements (TEs) and stimulate the production of epigenetically active small interfering RNAs. This activity is evident in the plant male gamete containing structure, the male gametophyte or pollen grain. How the dual role of plant miRNAs, regulating both genes and TEs, is integrated during pollen development and which mRNAs are regulated by miRNAs in this cell type at a genome-wide scale are unknown. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of miRNA dynamics and activity during pollen development in Arabidopsis thaliana using small RNA and degradome parallel analysis of RNA end high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, we uncover miRNAs loaded into the two main active Argonaute (AGO) proteins in the uninuclear and mature pollen grain, AGO1 and AGO5. Our results indicate that the developmental progression from microspore to mature pollen grain is characterized by a transition from miRNAs targeting developmental genes to miRNAs regulating TE activity.",

    "title": "Epigenetics and early domestication: differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between red junglefowl divergently selected for high or low fear of humans",
    "abstract": "Domestication of animals leads to large phenotypic alterations within a short evolutionary time-period. Such alterations are caused by genomic variations, yet the prevalence of modified traits is higher than expected if they were caused only by classical genetics and mutations. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be important in driving domesticated phenotypes such as behavior traits. Gene expression can be modulated epigenetically by mechanisms such as DNA methylation, resulting in modifications that are not only variable and susceptible to environmental stimuli, but also sometimes transgenerationally stable. To study such mechanisms in early domestication, we used as model two selected lines of red junglefowl (ancestors of modern chickens) that were bred for either high or low fear of humans over five generations, and investigated differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between the two populations.\n\nTwenty-two 1-kb windows were differentially methylated between the two selected lines at p < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction. The annotated functions of the genes within these windows indicated epigenetic regulation of metabolic and signaling pathways, which agrees with the changes in gene expression that were previously reported for the same tissue and animals.\n\nOur results show that selection for an important domestication-related behavioral trait such as tameness can cause divergent epigenetic patterns within only five generations, and that these changes could have an important role in chicken domestication.",

    "title": "Multi-transcriptome analysis following an acute skeletal muscle growth stimulus yields tools for discerning global and MYC regulatory networks.",
    "abstract": "Myc is a powerful transcription factor implicated in epigenetic reprogramming, cellular plasticity, and rapid growth as well as tumorigenesis. Cancer in skeletal muscle is extremely rare despite marked and sustained Myc induction during loading-induced hypertrophy. Here, we investigated global, actively transcribed, stable, and myonucleus-specific transcriptomes following an acute hypertrophic stimulus in mouse plantaris. With these datasets, we define global and Myc-specific dynamics at the onset of mechanical overload-induced muscle fiber growth. Data collation across analyses reveals an under-appreciated role for the muscle fiber in extracellular matrix remodeling during adaptation, along with the contribution of mRNA stability to epigenetic-related transcript levels in muscle. We also identify Runx1 and Ankrd1 (Marp1) as abundant myonucleus-enriched loading-induced genes. We observed that a strong induction of cell cycle regulators including Myc occurs with mechanical overload in myonuclei. Additionally, in vivo Myc-controlled gene expression in the plantaris was defined using a genetic muscle fiber-specific doxycycline-inducible Myc-overexpression model. We determined Myc is implicated in numerous aspects of gene expression during early-phase muscle fiber growth. Specifically, brief induction of Myc protein in muscle represses Reverbα, Reverbβ, and Myh2 while increasing Rpl3, recapitulating gene expression in myonuclei during acute overload. Experimental, comparative, and in silico analyses place Myc at the center of a stable and actively transcribed, loading-responsive, muscle fiber-localized regulatory hub. Collectively, our experiments are a roadmap for understanding global and Myc-mediated transcriptional networks that regulate rapid remodeling in postmitotic cells. We provide open webtools for exploring the five RNA-seq datasets as a resource to the field.",

    "title": "Altered levels of CSF proteins in patients with FTD, presymptomatic mutation carriers and non-carriers.",
    "abstract": "The clinical presentations of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are diverse and overlap with other neurological disorders. There are, as of today, no biomarkers in clinical practice for diagnosing the disorders. Here, we aimed to find protein markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with FTD, presymptomatic mutation carriers and non-carriers.\n\nAntibody suspension bead arrays were used to analyse 328 proteins in CSF from patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD, n = 16) and progressive primary aphasia (PPA, n = 13), as well as presymptomatic mutation carriers (PMC, n = 16) and non-carriers (NC, n = 8). A total of 492 antibodies were used to measure protein levels by direct labelling of the CSF samples. The findings were further examined in an independent cohort including 13 FTD patients, 79 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 18 healthy controls.\n\nWe found significantly altered protein levels in CSF from FTD patients compared to unaffected individuals (PMC and NC) for 26 proteins. The analysis show patterns of separation between unaffected individuals and FTD patients, especially for those with a clinical diagnosis of bvFTD. The most statistically significant differences in protein levels were found for VGF, TN-R, NPTXR, TMEM132D, PDYN and NF-M. Patients with FTD were found to have higher levels of TN-R and NF-M, and lower levels of VGF, NPTXR, TMEM132D and PDYN, compared to unaffected individuals. The main findings were reproduced in the independent cohort.\n\nIn this pilot study, we show a separation of FTD patients from unaffected individuals based on protein levels in CSF. Further investigation is required to explore the CSF profiles in larger cohorts, but the results presented here has the potential to enable future clinical utilization of these potential biomarkers within FTD.",

    "title": "Mitochondrial genomes from Bronze Age Poland reveal genetic continuity from the Late Neolithic and additional genetic affinities with the steppe populations.",
    "abstract": "In this work we aim to investigate the origins and genetic affinities of Bronze Age populations (2,400-1,100 BC) from the region of southern Poland and to trace maternal kinship patterns present in the burials of those populations by the use of complete mitochondrial genomes.\n\nWe performed ancient DNA analyses for Bronze Age individuals from present-day Poland associated with the Strzyżow culture, the Mierzanowice culture, and the Trzciniec Cultural circle. To obtain complete mitochondrial genomes, we sequenced genomic libraries using Illumina platform. Additionally, hybridization capture was used to enrich some of the samples for mitochondrial DNA. AMS 14 C-dating was conducted for 51 individuals to verify chronological and cultural attribution of the analyzed samples.\n\nComplete ancient mitochondrial genomes were generated for 80 of the Bronze Age individuals from present-day Poland. The results of the population genetic analyses indicate close maternal genetic affinity between Mierzanowice, Trzciniec, and Corded Ware culture-associated populations. This is in contrast to the genetically more distant Strzyżów people that displayed closer maternal genetic relation to steppe populations associated with the preceding Yamnaya culture and Catacomb culture, and with later Scythians. Potential maternal kinship relations were identified in burials of Mierzanowice and Trzciniec populations analyzed in this study.\n\nResults revealed genetic continuity from the Late Neolithic Corded Ware groups to Bronze Age Mierzanowice and Trzciniec-associated populations, and possible additional genetic contribution from the steppe to the formation of the Strzyżów-associated group at the end of 3rd millennium BC. Mitochondrial patterns indicated several pairs of potentially maternally related individuals mostly in Trzciniec-associated group.",

    "abstract": "Long-read sequencing can resolve regions of the genome that are inaccessible to short reads, and therefore are ideal for genome-gap closure, solving structural rearrangements and sequencing through repetitive elements. Here we introduce the Xdrop technology: a novel microfluidic-based system that allows for targeted enrichment of long DNA molecules starting from only a few nanograms of DNA. Xdrop is based on the isolation of long DNA fragments in millions of droplets, where the droplets containing a target sequence of interest are fluorescently labeled and sorted using flow cytometry. The final product from the Xdrop procedure is an enriched population of long DNA molecules that can be investigated by sequencing. To demonstrate the capability of Xdrop, we performed enrichment of the human papilloma virus 18 integrated into the genome of human HeLa cells. Analysis of the sequencing reads resolved three HPV18-chr8 integrations at base-pair resolution, and the captured fragments extended up to 30 kb into the human genome at the integration sites. Further, we enriched the complete TP53 locus in a leukemia cell line and could successfully phase coexisting mutations using PacBio sequencing. In summary, our results show that Xdrop is an efficient enrichment technology for studying complex genomic regions.",

    "title": "Hemostatic Genes Exhibit a High Degree of Allele-Specific Regulation in Liver.",
    "abstract": "Elucidating the genetic basis underlying hepatic hemostatic gene expression variability may contribute to unraveling genetic factors contributing to thrombotic or bleeding disorders. We aimed to identify novel cis-regulatory variants involved in regulating hemostatic genes by analyzing allele-specific expression (ASE) in human liver samples.\r\n\r\nBiopsies of human liver tissue and blood were collected from adults undergoing liver surgery at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital ( n = 20). Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (gDNA) and total ribonucleic acid (RNA) were isolated. A targeted approach was used to enrich and sequence 35 hemostatic genes for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis (gDNAseq) and construct individualized genomes for transcript alignment. The allelic ratio of transcripts from targeted RNAseq was determined via ASE analysis. Public expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were used to assess novelty and importance of the ASE SNPs (and proxies, r2 ≥ 0.8) for relevant traits/diseases.\r\n\r\nSixty percent of the genes studied showed allelic imbalance across 53 SNPs. Of these, 7 SNPs were previously validated in liver eQTL studies. For 32 with eQTLs in other cell/tissue types, this is the first time genotype-specific expression is demonstrated in liver, and for 14 ASE SNPs, this is the first ever reported genotype-expression association. A total of 29 ASE SNPs were previously associated with the respective plasma protein levels and 17 ASE SNPs to other relevant GWAS traits including venous thromboembolism, coronary artery disease, and stroke.\r\n\r\nOur study provides a comprehensive ASE analysis of hemostatic genes and insights into the regulation of hemostatic genes in human liver.",
