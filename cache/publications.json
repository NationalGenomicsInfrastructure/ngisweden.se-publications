    "title": "A computational screen for site selective A-to-I editing detects novel sites in neuron specific Hu proteins.",
    "abstract": "Several bioinformatic approaches have previously been used to find novel sites of ADAR mediated A-to-I RNA editing in human. These studies have discovered thousands of genes that are hyper-edited in their non-coding intronic regions, especially in alu retrotransposable elements, but very few substrates that are site-selectively edited in coding regions. Known RNA edited substrates suggest, however, that site selective A-to-I editing is particularly important for normal brain development in mammals.\n\nWe have compiled a screen that enables the identification of new sites of site-selective editing, primarily in coding sequences. To avoid hyper-edited repeat regions, we applied our screen to the alu-free mouse genome. Focusing on the mouse also facilitated better experimental verification. To identify candidate sites of RNA editing, we first performed an explorative screen based on RNA structure and genomic sequence conservation. We further evaluated the results of the explorative screen by determining which transcripts were enriched for A-G mismatches between the genomic template and the expressed sequence since the editing product, inosine (I), is read as guanosine (G) by the translational machinery. For expressed sequences, we only considered coding regions to focus entirely on re-coding events. Lastly, we refined the results from the explorative screen using a novel scoring scheme based on characteristics for known A-to-I edited sites. The extent of editing in the final candidate genes was verified using total RNA from mouse brain and 454 sequencing.\n\nUsing this method, we identified and confirmed efficient editing at one site in the Gabra3 gene. Editing was also verified at several other novel sites within candidates predicted to be edited. Five of these sites are situated in genes coding for the neuron-specific RNA binding proteins HuB and HuD.",

    "title": "Investigation of a putative melanoma susceptibility locus at chromosome 3q29.",
    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma, the most fatal form of skin cancer, is currently increasing in incidence in many populations. Approximately 10% of all cases occur in families with an inherited predisposition for melanoma. In Sweden, only a minor portion of such melanoma families carry a mutation in the known melanoma gene CDKN2A, and there is a need to identify additional melanoma susceptibility genes. In a recently performed genome-wide linkage screen, novel loci with suggestive evidence of linkage to melanoma were detected. In this study, we have further analyzed one region on chromosome 3q29. In all, 89 affected and 15 nonaffected family members from 42 melanoma-prone families were genotyped for 34 genetic markers. In a pooled linkage analysis of all 42 families, we detected significant evidence of linkage, with a maximum heterogeneity logarithm of odds (HLOD) score of 3.1 with 83% of the families contributing to the linkage score. The minimum critical region of linkage (defined by a 1LOD score support interval) maps to chromosome 3q29, spans 3.5 Mb of genomic sequence, and harbors 44 identified genes. Sequence variants within this region have previously been associated with cancer susceptibility. This study reports the presence of a putative novel melanoma susceptibility locus in the Swedish population, a finding that needs to be replicated in an independent study on other individuals with familial melanoma. Sequencing of genes in the region may identify novel melanoma-associated mutations.",

    "abstract": "The detection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in minor viral populations is of potential clinical importance. However, sophisticated computational infrastructure and competence for analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data lack at most diagnostic laboratories. Thus, we have proposed a new pipeline, MiDRM pol, to quantify DRM from the HIV-1 pol region. The gag-vpu region of 87 plasma samples from HIV-infected individuals from three cohorts was amplified and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq2500. The sequence reads were adapter-trimmed, followed by analysis using in-house scripts. Samples from Swedish and Ethiopian cohorts were also sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The pipeline was validated against the online tool PASeq (Polymorphism Analysis by Sequencing). Based on an error rate of <1%, a value of >1% was set as reliable to consider a minor variant. Both pipelines detected the mutations in the dominant viral populations, while discrepancies were observed in minor viral populations. In five HIV-1 subtype C samples, minor mutations were detected at the <5% level by MiDRMpol but not by PASeq. MiDRMpol is a computationally as well as labor efficient bioinformatics pipeline for the detection of DRM from HTS data. It identifies minor viral populations (<20%) of DRMs. Our method can be incorporated into large-scale surveillance of HIV-1 DRM.",

Three pugs had clinical signs including, lameness, bone deformities, and dyspnea. One other pug was found dead. Radiographs of 2 affected pugs, 5 and 6 months old, showed generalized widening, and irregular margination of the physes of both the appendicular and the axial skeleton with generalized decrease in bone opacity and bulbous swelling of the costochondral junctions. Two pugs had low serum calcium and 1,25 (OH)2 D3 concentrations. Test results further indicated secondary hyperparathyroidism with adequate concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Necropsy revealed tongue-like projections of cartilage extending into the metaphysis consistent with rickets, loss of metaphyseal mineralization and lung pathology. Vitamin D-dependent rickets was diagnosed. A truncating mutation in the 1α-hydroxylase gene (CYP27B1) was identified by genome sequence analysis of the pugs with VDDR type 1A. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A can occur in young pugs, and if left untreated is a life-threatening condition. Early medical intervention can reverse clinical signs and should be instituted as soon as possible.",

    "abstract": "Urban lakes provide multiple benefits to society while influencing life quality. Moreover, lakes and their microbiomes are sentinels of anthropogenic impact and can be used for natural resource management and planning. Here, we release original metagenomic data from several well-characterized and anthropogenically impacted eutrophic lakes in the vicinity of Stockholm (Sweden). Our goal was to collect representative microbial community samples and use shotgun sequencing to provide a broad view on microbial diversity of productive urban lakes. Our dataset has an emphasis on Lake Mälaren as a major drinking water reservoir under anthropogenic impact. This dataset includes short-read sequence data and metagenome assemblies from each of 17 samples collected from eutrophic lakes near the greater Stockholm area. We used genome-resolved metagenomics and obtained 2378 metagenome assembled genomes that de-replicated into 514 species representative genomes. This dataset adds new datapoints to previously sequenced lakes and it includes the first sequenced set of metagenomes from Lake Mälaren. Our dataset serves as a baseline for future monitoring of drinking water reservoirs and urban lakes.",

    "abstract": "The bacterium Escherichia coli is the most widely used expression host for overexpression trials of membrane proteins. Usually, different strains, culture conditions and expression regimes are screened for to identify the optimal overexpression strategy. However, yields are often not satisfactory, especially for eukaryotic membrane proteins. This has initiated a revolution of membrane protein overexpression in bacteria. Recent studies have shown that it is feasible to (i) engineer or select for E. coli strains with strongly improved membrane protein overexpression characteristics, (ii) use bacteria other than E. coli for the expression of membrane proteins, (iii) engineer or select for membrane protein variants that retain functionality but express better than the wild-type protein, and (iv) express membrane proteins using E. coli-based cell-free systems.",

    "abstract": "The taxonomic composition of a microbial community can be deduced by analyzing its rRNA gene content by, e.g., high-throughput DNA sequencing or DNA chips. Such methods typically are based on PCR amplification of rRNA gene sequences using broad-taxonomic-range PCR primers. In these analyses, the use of optimal primers is crucial for achieving an unbiased representation of community composition. Here, we present the computer program DegePrime that, for each position of a multiple sequence alignment, finds a degenerate oligomer of as high coverage as possible and outputs its coverage among taxonomic divisions. We show that our novel heuristic, which we call weighted randomized combination, performs better than previously described algorithms for solving the maximum coverage degenerate primer design problem. We previously used DegePrime to design a broad-taxonomic-range primer pair that targets the bacterial V3-V4 region (341F-805R) (D. P. Herlemann, M. Labrenz, K. Jurgens, S. Bertilsson, J. J. Waniek, and A. F. Andersson, ISME J. 5:1571-1579, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2011.41), and here we use the program to significantly increase the coverage of a primer pair (515F-806R) widely used for Illumina-based surveys of bacterial and archaeal diversity. By comparison with shotgun metagenomics, we show that the primers give an accurate representation of microbial diversity in natural samples.",

    "title": "Effects of the Antimicrobial Peptide LL-37 and Innate Effector Mechanisms in Colistin-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae With mgrB Insertions.",
    "abstract": "Colistin is a polypeptide antibiotic drug that targets lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Inactivation of the mgrB-gene is a common mechanism behind colistin-resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn). Since colistin is a cyclic polypeptide, it may exhibit cross-resistance with the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, and with other innate effector mechanisms, but previous results are inconclusive.\n\nTo study potential cross-resistance between colistin and LL-37, as well as with other innate effector mechanisms, and to compare virulence of colistin-resistant and susceptible Kpn strains.\n\nCarbapenemase-producing Kpn from Oman ( n = 17) were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole genome sequencing. Susceptibility to colistin and LL-37 was studied. The surface charge was determined by zeta-potential measurements and the morphology of treated bacteria was analyzed with electron microscopy. Bacterial survival was assessed in human whole blood and serum, as well as in a zebrafish infection-model.\n\nGenome-analysis revealed insertion-sequences in the mgrB gene, as a cause of colistin resistance in 8/17 isolates. Colistin-resistant (Col-R) isolates were found to be more resistant to LL-37 compared to colistin-susceptible (Col-S) isolates, but only at concentrations ≥50 μg/ml. There was no significant difference in surface charge between the isolates. The morphological changes were similar in both Col-R and Col-S isolates after exposure to LL-37. Finally, no survival difference between the Col-R and Col-S isolates was observed in whole blood or serum, or in zebrafish embryos.\n\nCross-resistance between colistin and LL-37 was observed at elevated concentrations of LL-37. However, Col-R and Col-S isolates exhibited similar survival in serum and whole blood, and in a zebrafish infection-model, suggesting that cross-resistance most likely play a limited role during physiological conditions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the observed cross-resistance could be relevant in conditions where LL-37 levels reach high concentrations, such as during infection or inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Population translocations occur for a variety of reasons, from displacement due to climate change to human-induced transfers. Such actions have adverse effects on genetic variation and understanding their microevolutionary consequences requires monitoring. Here, we return to an experimental release of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in order to monitor the genomic effects of population translocations. In 1979, fish from each of two genetically (F ST = 0.16) and ecologically separate populations were simultaneously released, at one point in time, to a lake system previously void of brown trout. Here, whole-genome sequencing of pooled DNA (Pool-seq) is used to characterize diversity within and divergence between the introduced populations and fish inhabiting two lakes downstream of the release sites, sampled 30 years later (c. 5 generations). Present results suggest that while extensive hybridization has occurred, the two introduced populations are unequally represented in the lakes downstream of the release sites. One population, which is ecologically resident in its original habitat, mainly contributes to the lake closest to the release site. The other population, migratory in its natal habitat, is genetically more represented in the lake further downstream. Genomic regions putatively under directional selection in the new habitat are identified, where allele frequencies in both established populations are more similar to the introduced population stemming from a resident population than the migratory one. Results suggest that the microevolutionary consequences of population translocations, for example, hybridization and adaptation, can be rapid and that Pool-seq can be used as an initial tool to monitor genome-wide effects.",

    "title": "Bioinformatic tools for using whole genome sequencing as a rapid high resolution diagnostic typing tool when tracing bioterror organisms in the food and feed chain.",
    "abstract": "The rapid technological development in the field of parallel sequencing offers new opportunities when tracing and tracking microorganisms in the food and feed chain. If a bioterror organism is deliberately spread it is of crucial importance to get as much information as possible regarding the strain as fast as possible to aid the decision process and select suitable controls, tracing and tracking tools. A lot of efforts have been made to sequence multiple strains of potential bioterror organisms so there is a relatively large set of reference genomes available. This study is focused on how to use parallel sequencing for rapid phylogenomic analysis and screen for genetic modifications. A bioinformatic methodology has been developed to rapidly analyze sequence data with minimal post-processing. Instead of assembling the genome, defining genes, defining orthologous relations and calculating distances, the present method can achieve a similar high resolution directly from the raw sequence data. The method defines orthologous sequence reads instead of orthologous genes and the average similarity of the core genome (ASC) is calculated. The sequence reads from the core and from the non-conserved genomic regions can also be separated for further analysis. Finally, the comparison algorithm is used to visualize the phylogenomic diversity of the bacterial bioterror organisms Bacillus anthracis and Clostridium botulinum using heat plot diagrams.",

    "title": "Development and characterization of an EMS-mutagenized wheat population and identification of salt-tolerant wheat lines.",
    "abstract": "Triticum aestivum (wheat) is one of the world's oldest crops and has been used for >8000 years as a food crop in North Africa, West Asia and Europe. Today, wheat is one of the most important sources of grain for humans, and is cultivated on greater areas of land than any other crop. As the human population increases and soil salinity becomes more prevalent, there is increased pressure on wheat breeders to develop salt-tolerant varieties in order to meet growing demands for yield and grain quality. Here we developed a mutant wheat population using the moderately salt-tolerant Bangladeshi variety BARI Gom-25, with the primary goal of further increasing salt tolerance.\n\nAfter titrating the optimal ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) concentration, ca 30,000 seeds were treated with 1% EMS, and 1676 lines, all originating from single seeds, survived through the first four generations. Most mutagenized lines showed a similar phenotype to BARI Gom-25, although visual differences such as dwarfing, giant plants, early and late flowering and altered leaf morphology were seen in some lines. By developing an assay for salt tolerance, and by screening the mutagenized population, we identified 70 lines exhibiting increased salt tolerance. The selected lines typically showed a 70% germination rate on filter paper soaked in 200 mM NaCl, compared to 0-30% for BARI Gom-25. From two of the salt-tolerant OlsAro lines (OA42 and OA70), genomic DNA was sequenced to 15x times coverage. A comparative analysis against the BARI Gom-25 genomic sequence identified a total of 683,201 (OA42), and 768,954 (OA70) SNPs distributed throughout the three sub-genomes (A, B and D). The mutation frequency was determined to be approximately one per 20,000 bp. All the 70 selected salt-tolerant lines were tested for root growth in the laboratory, and under saline field conditions in Bangladesh. The results showed that all the lines selected for tolerance showed a better salt tolerance phenotype than both BARI Gom-25 and other local wheat varieties tested.\n\nThe mutant wheat population developed here will be a valuable resource in the development of novel salt-tolerant varieties for the benefit of saline farming.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 5-10 % of all cutaneous melanomas occur in families with hereditary melanoma predisposition. Worldwide, approximately 20-40% of kindreds with familial elanoma harbor germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene, located on chromosome 9p21, which encodes two different proteins, p16INK4 and p14ARF, both involved in regulation of cell cycle progression and induction of senescence. In different populations several recurring CDKN2A founder mutations have been described. The risk of melanoma in CDKN2A mutations carriers varies between populations and is higher in regions with high sun exposure and high incidence of melanoma in the general population. Some CDKN2A mutations have been associated not only with melanoma but also with increased risk of other malignancies--most notably pancreatic carcinoma. A much smaller number of families have germline mutations in the CDK4 gene on chromosome 12q14, encoding a cyclin dependent kinase which normally interacts with p16INK4A. The management of families with hereditary melanoma is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila genome encodes three BEN-solo proteins including Insensitive (Insv), Elba1 and Elba2 that possess activities in transcriptional repression and chromatin insulation. A fourth protein-Elba3-bridges Elba1 and Elba2 to form an ELBA complex. Here, we report comprehensive investigation of these proteins in Drosophila embryos. We assess common and distinct binding sites for Insv and ELBA and their genetic interdependencies. While Elba1 and Elba2 binding generally requires the ELBA complex, Elba3 can associate with chromatin independently of Elba1 and Elba2. We further demonstrate that ELBA collaborates with other insulators to regulate developmental patterning. Finally, we find that adjacent gene pairs separated by an ELBA bound sequence become less differentially expressed in ELBA mutants. Transgenic reporters confirm the insulating activity of ELBA- and Insv-bound sites. These findings define ELBA and Insv as general insulator proteins in Drosophila and demonstrate the functional importance of insulators to partition transcription units.",

    "title": "Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of hoarding symptoms in 27,537 individuals.",
    "abstract": "Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a mental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties discarding or parting with possessions, often resulting in cluttered living spaces, distress, and impairment. Its etiology is largely unknown, but twin studies suggest that it is moderately heritable. In this study, we pooled phenotypic and genomic data from seven international cohorts (N = 27,537 individuals) and conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of parent- or self-reported hoarding symptoms (HS). We followed up the results with gene-based and gene-set analyses, as well as leave-one-out HS polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses. To examine a possible genetic association between hoarding symptoms and other phenotypes we conducted cross-trait PRS analyses. Though we did not report any genome-wide significant SNPs, we report heritability estimates for the twin-cohorts between 26-48%, and a SNP-heritability of 11% for an unrelated sub-cohort. Cross-trait PRS analyses showed that the genetic risk for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder were significantly associated with hoarding symptoms. We also found suggestive evidence for an association with educational attainment. There were no significant associations with other phenotypes previously linked to HD, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. To conclude, we found that HS are heritable, confirming and extending previous twin studies but we had limited power to detect any genome-wide significant loci. Much larger samples will be needed to further extend these findings and reach a \"gene discovery zone\". To move the field forward, future research should not only include genetic analyses of quantitative hoarding traits in larger samples, but also in samples of individuals meeting strict diagnostic criteria for HD, and more ethnically diverse samples.",

    "title": "African and Asian leopards are highly differentiated at the genomic level.",
    "abstract": "Leopards are the only big cats still widely distributed across the continents of Africa and Asia. They occur in a wide range of habitats and are often found in close proximity to humans. But despite their ubiquity, leopard phylogeography and population history have not yet been studied with genomic tools. Here, we present population-genomic data from 26 modern and historical samples encompassing the vast geographical distribution of this species. We find that Asian leopards are broadly monophyletic with respect to African leopards across almost their entire nuclear genomes. This profound genetic pattern persists despite the animals' high potential mobility, and despite evidence of transfer of African alleles into Middle Eastern and Central Asian leopard populations within the last 100,000 years. Our results further suggest that Asian leopards originated from a single out-of-Africa dispersal event 500-600 thousand years ago and are characterized by higher population structuring, stronger isolation by distance, and lower heterozygosity than African leopards. Taxonomic categories do not take into account the variability in depth of divergence among subspecies. The deep divergence between the African subspecies and Asian populations contrasts with the much shallower divergence among putative Asian subspecies. Reconciling genomic variation and taxonomy is likely to be a growing challenge in the genomics era.",

    "title": "Single-cell multimodal analysis in a case with reduced penetrance of Progranulin-Frontotemporal Dementia.",
    "abstract": "We identified an autosomal dominant progranulin mutation carrier without symptoms of dementia in her lifetime (Reduced Penetrance Mutation Carrier, RedPenMC). This resistance to develop expected pathology presents a unique opportunity to interrogate neurodegenerative mechanisms. We performed multimodal single-nuclei analyses of post-mortem frontal cortex from RedPenMC, including transcriptomics and global levels of chromatin marks. RedPenMC had an increased ratio of GRN-expressing microglia, higher levels of activating histone mark H3k4me3 in microglia and lower levels of the repressive chromatin marks H3k9me1 and H3k9me3 in the frontal cortex than her affected mutation carrier son and evidence of higher protein levels of progranulin in both plasma and brain homogenates. Although the study is limited to one case, the results support that restoring brain progranulin levels may be sufficient to escape neurodegeneration and FTD. In addition to previously identified modifier genes, it is possible that epigenetic marks may contribute to the increased progranulin expression in cases of reduced penetrance. These findings may stimulate similar follow-up studies and new therapeutic approaches.",

    "title": "Limited Parallelism in Genetic Adaptation to Brackish Water Bodies in European Sprat and Atlantic Herring.",
    "abstract": "The European sprat is a small plankton-feeding clupeid present in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, in the Mediterranean Sea, and in the brackish Baltic Sea and Black Sea. This species is the target of a major fishery and, therefore, an accurate characterization of its genetic population structure is crucial to delineate proper stock assessments that aid ensuring the fishery's sustainability. Here, we present (i) a draft genome assembly, (ii) pooled whole genome sequencing of 19 population samples covering most of the species' distribution range, and (iii) the design and test of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-chip resource and use this to validate the population structure inferred from pooled sequencing. These approaches revealed, using the populations sampled here, three major groups of European sprat: Oceanic, Coastal, and Brackish with limited differentiation within groups even over wide geographical stretches. Genetic structure is largely driven by six large putative inversions that differentiate Oceanic and Brackish sprats, while Coastal populations display intermediate frequencies of haplotypes at each locus. Interestingly, populations from the Baltic and the Black Seas share similar frequencies of haplotypes at these putative inversions despite their distant geographic location. The closely related clupeids European sprat and Atlantic herring both show genetic adaptation to the brackish Baltic Sea, providing an opportunity to explore the extent of genetic parallelism. This analysis revealed limited parallelism because out of 125 independent loci detected in the Atlantic herring, three showed sharp signals of selection that overlapped between the two species and contained single genes such as PRLRA, which encodes the receptor for prolactin, a freshwater-adapting hormone in euryhaline species, and THRB, a receptor for thyroid hormones, important both for metabolic regulation and the development of red cone photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Newts have large genomes harboring many repeat elements. How these elements shape the genome and relate to newts' unique regeneration ability remains unknown. We present here the chromosome-scale assembly of the 20.3 Gb genome of the Iberian ribbed newt, Pleurodeles waltl, with a hitherto unprecedented contiguity and completeness among giant genomes. Utilizing this assembly, we demonstrate conserved synteny as well as genetic rearrangements, such as in the major histocompatibility complex locus. We provide evidence suggesting that intronic repeat elements drive newt-specific circular RNA (circRNA) biogenesis and show their regeneration-specific expression. We also present a comprehensive in-depth annotation and chromosomal mapping of microRNAs, highlighting genomic expansion profiles as well as a distinct regulatory pattern in the regenerating limb. These data reveal links between repeat elements, non-coding RNAs, and adult regeneration and provide key resources for addressing developmental, regenerative, and evolutionary principles.",
