    "title": "Spatial detection of fetal marker genes expressed at low level in adult human heart tissue.",
    "abstract": "Heart failure is a major health problem linked to poor quality of life and high mortality rates. Hence, novel biomarkers, such as fetal marker genes with low expression levels, could potentially differentiate disease states in order to improve therapy. In many studies on heart failure, cardiac biopsies have been analyzed as uniform pieces of tissue with bulk techniques, but this homogenization approach can mask medically relevant phenotypes occurring only in isolated parts of the tissue. This study examines such spatial variations within and between regions of cardiac biopsies. In contrast to standard RNA sequencing, this approach provides a spatially resolved transcriptome- and tissue-wide perspective of the adult human heart, and enables detection of fetal marker genes expressed by minor subpopulations of cells within the tissue. Analysis of patients with heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction, demonstrated spatially divergent expression of fetal genes in cardiac biopsies.",

    "abstract": "Long-term survival and integration of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transplanted following spinal cord injury (SCI) have been observed. However, questions concerning the differentiation choice, the mechanism of action, and the contribution of NPCs to functional recovery remains unanswered. Therefore, we investigated the differentiation of NPCs, global transcriptomal changes in transplanted NPCs, the effect of NPCs on neuroinflammation, and the causality between NPC transplantation and functional recovery. We found that NPCs transplanted following SCI differentiate mainly into oligodendrocytes and enhance myelination, upregulate genes related to synaptic signaling and mitochondrial activity, and downregulate genes related to cytokine production and immune system response. NPCs suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines; moreover, NPC ablation confirm that NPCs were responsible for enhanced recovery in hindlimb locomotor function. Understanding the reaction of transplanted NPCs is important for exploiting their full potential. Existence of causality implies that NPCs are useful in the treatment of SCI.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the periodontal health of patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in relation to oral microbiota, systemic and oral inflammatory mediators, and RA disease activity. Forty patients underwent full-mouth dental/periodontal and rheumatological examination, including collection of blood, saliva, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and subgingival plaque. Composition of plaque and saliva microbiota were analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing and levels of inflammatory mediators by multiplex-immunoassay. The majority of the patients (75%) had moderate or severe periodontitis and the rest had no/mild periodontitis. Anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity was significantly more frequent in the moderate/severe periodontitis (86%) compared to the no/mild group (50%). No significance between groups was observed for RA disease duration or activity, or type of medication. Levels of sCD30/TNFRSF8, IFN-α2, IL-19, IL-26, MMP-1, gp130/sIL-6Rß, and sTNF-R1 were significantly higher in serum or GCF, and April/TNFSF13 was significantly higher in serum and saliva samples in moderate/severe periodontitis. The microbial composition in plaque also differed significantly between the two groups. In conclusion, the majority of RA patients had moderate/severe periodontitis and that this severe form of the disease was significantly associated with ACPA positivity, an altered subgingival microbial profile, and increased levels of systemic and oral inflammatory mediators.",

    "title": "Labile Dissolved Organic Matter Compound Characteristics Select for Divergence in Marine Bacterial Activity and Transcription.",
    "abstract": "Bacteria play a key role in the planetary carbon cycle partly because they rapidly assimilate labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean. However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms at work when bacterioplankton metabolize distinct components of the DOM pool is still limited. We, therefore, conducted seawater culture enrichment experiments with ecologically relevant DOM, combining both polymer and monomer model compounds for distinct compound classes. This included carbohydrates (polysaccharides vs. monosaccharides), proteins (polypeptides vs. amino acids), and nucleic acids (DNA vs. nucleotides). We noted pronounced changes in bacterial growth, activity, and transcription related to DOM characteristics. Transcriptional responses differed between compound classes, with distinct gene sets (\"core genes\") distinguishing carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. Moreover, we found a strong divergence in functional transcription at the level of particular monomers and polymers (i.e., the condensation state), primarily in the carbohydrates and protein compound classes. These specific responses included a variety of cellular and metabolic processes that were mediated by distinct bacterial taxa, suggesting pronounced functional partitioning of organic matter. Collectively, our findings show that two important facets of DOM, compound class and condensation state, shape bacterial gene expression, and ultimately select for distinct bacterial (functional) groups. This emphasizes the interdependency of marine bacteria and labile carbon compounds for regulating the transformation of DOM in surface waters.",

    "title": "Systems biology of acidophile biofilms for efficient metal extraction.",
    "abstract": "Society's demand for metals is ever increasing while stocks of high-grade minerals are being depleted. Biomining, for example of chalcopyrite for copper recovery, is a more sustainable biotechnological process that exploits the capacity of acidophilic microbes to catalyze solid metal sulfide dissolution to soluble metal sulfates. A key early stage in biomining is cell attachment and biofilm formation on the mineral surface that results in elevated mineral oxidation rates. Industrial biomining of chalcopyrite is typically carried out in large scale heaps that suffer from the downsides of slow and poor metal recoveries. In an effort to mitigate these drawbacks, this study investigated planktonic and biofilm cells of acidophilic (optimal growth pH < 3) biomining bacteria. RNA and proteins were extracted, and high throughput \"omics\" performed from a total of 80 biomining experiments. In addition, micrographs of biofilm formation on the chalcopyrite mineral surface over time were generated from eight separate experiments. The dataset generated in this project will be of great use to microbiologists, biotechnologists, and industrial researchers.",

    "title": "Species and gene divergence in Littorina snails detected by array comparative genomic hybridization.",
    "abstract": "Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is commonly used to screen different types of genetic variation in humans and model species. Here, we performed aCGH using an oligonucleotide gene-expression array for a non-model species, the intertidal snail Littorina saxatilis. First, we tested what types of genetic variation can be detected by this method using direct re-sequencing and comparison to the Littorina genome draft. Secondly, we performed a genome-wide comparison of four closely related Littorina species: L. fabalis, L. compressa, L. arcana and L. saxatilis and of populations of L. saxatilis found in Spain, Britain and Sweden. Finally, we tested whether we could identify genetic variation underlying \"Crab\" and \"Wave\" ecotypes of L. saxatilis.\n\nWe could reliably detect copy number variations, deletions and high sequence divergence (i.e. above 3%), but not single nucleotide polymorphisms. The overall hybridization pattern and number of significantly diverged genes were in close agreement with earlier phylogenetic reconstructions based on single genes. The trichotomy of L. arcana, L. compressa and L. saxatilis could not be resolved and we argue that these divergence events have occurred recently and very close in time. We found evidence for high levels of segmental duplication in the Littorina genome (10% of the transcripts represented on the array and up to 23% of the analyzed genomic fragments); duplicated genes and regions were mostly the same in all analyzed species. Finally, this method discriminated geographically distant populations of L. saxatilis, but we did not detect any significant genome divergence associated with ecotypes of L. saxatilis.\n\nThe present study provides new information on the sensitivity and the potential use of oligonucleotide arrays for genotyping of non-model organisms. Applying this method to Littorina species yields insights into genome evolution following the recent species radiation and supports earlier single-gene based phylogenies. Genetic differentiation of L. saxatilis ecotypes was not detected in this study, despite pronounced innate phenotypic differences. The reason may be that these differences are due to single-nucleotide polymorphisms.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive and reliable protein biomarkers are needed to predict disease trajectory and personalize treatment strategies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we use the highly sensitive proximity-extension assay combined with next-generation sequencing (Olink Explore) to quantify 1463 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 143 people with early-stage MS and 43 healthy controls. With longitudinally followed discovery and replication cohorts, we identify CSF proteins that consistently predicted both short- and long-term disease progression. Lower levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF is superior in predicting the absence of disease activity two years after sampling (replication AUC = 0.77) compared to all other tested proteins. Importantly, we also identify a combination of 11 CSF proteins (CXCL13, LTA, FCN2, ICAM3, LY9, SLAMF7, TYMP, CHI3L1, FYB1, TNFRSF1B and NfL) that predict the severity of disability worsening according to the normalized age-related MS severity score (replication AUC = 0.90). The identification of these proteins may help elucidate pathogenetic processes and might aid decisions on treatment strategies for persons with MS.",

    "title": "Population genomic history of the endangered Anatolian and Cyprian mouflons in relation to worldwide wild, feral and domestic sheep lineages.",
    "abstract": "Once widespread in their homelands, the Anatolian mouflon (Ovis gmelini anatolica) and the Cyprian mouflon (Ovis gmelini ophion) were driven to near extinction during the 20th century and are currently listed as endangered populations by the IUCN. While the exact origins of these lineages remain unclear, they have been suggested to be close relatives of domestic sheep or remnants of proto-domestic sheep. Here, we study whole genome sequences of n = 5 Anatolian mouflons and n = 10 Cyprian mouflons in terms of population history and diversity, comparing them to eight other extant sheep lineages. We find reciprocal genetic affinity between Anatolian and Cyprian mouflons and domestic sheep, higher than all other studied wild sheep genomes, including the Iranian mouflon (Ovis gmelini). Studying diversity indices, we detect a considerable load of short runs of homozygosity (ROH) blocks (<2 Mb) in both Anatolian and Cyprian mouflons, reflecting small effective population size (Ne). Meanwhile, Ne as well as mutation load estimates are lower in Cyprian compared to Anatolian mouflons, suggesting the purging of recessive deleterious variants in Cyprian sheep under a small long-term Ne, possibly attributable to founder effects, island isolation, introgression from domestic lineages, or differences in their bottleneck dynamics. Expanding our analyses to worldwide wild and feral Ovis genomes, we observe varying viability metrics among different lineages, and a limited consistency between viability metrics and IUCN conservation status. Factors such as recent inbreeding, introgression, and unique population dynamics may have contributed to the observed disparities.",

    "title": "Plastid phylogenomics and cytonuclear discordance in Rubioideae, Rubiaceae.",
    "abstract": "In this study of evolutionary relationships in the subfamily Rubioideae (Rubiaceae), we take advantage of the off-target proportion of reads generated via previous target capture sequencing projects based on nuclear genomic data to build a plastome phylogeny and investigate cytonuclear discordance. The assembly of off-target reads resulted in a comprehensive plastome dataset and robust inference of phylogenetic relationships, where most intratribal and intertribal relationships are resolved with strong support. While the phylogenetic results were mostly in agreement with previous studies based on plastome data, novel relationships in the plastid perspective were also detected. For example, our analyses of plastome data provide strong support for the SCOUT clade and its sister relationship to the remaining members of the subfamily, which differs from previous results based on plastid data but agrees with recent results based on nuclear genomic data. However, several instances of highly supported cytonuclear discordance were identified across the Rubioideae phylogeny. Coalescent simulation analysis indicates that while ILS could, by itself, explain the majority of the discordant relationships, plastome introgression may be the better explanation in some cases. Our study further indicates that plastomes across the Rubioideae are, with few exceptions, highly conserved and mainly conform to the structure, gene content, and gene order present in the majority of the flowering plants.",

    "title": "Ebullition dominates methane emissions in stratified coastal waters.",
    "abstract": "Coastal areas are an important source of methane (CH4). However, the exact origins of CH4 in the surface waters of coastal regions, which in turn drive sea-air emissions, remain uncertain. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current and future climate change feedbacks, it is crucial to identify these CH4 sources and processes that regulate its formation and oxidation. This study investigated coastal CH4 dynamics by comparing water column data from six stations located in the brackish Tvärminne Archipelago, Baltic Sea. The sediment biogeochemistry and microbiology were further investigated at two stations (i.e., nearshore and offshore). These stations differed in terms of stratification, bottom water redox conditions, and organic matter loading. At the nearshore station, CH4 diffusion from the sediment into the water column was negligible, because nearly all CH4 was oxidized within the upper sediment column before reaching the sediment surface. On the other hand, at the offshore station, there was significant benthic diffusion of CH4, albeit the majority underwent oxidation before reaching the sediment-water interface, due to shoaling of the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The potential contribution of CH4 production in the water column was evaluated and was found to be negligible. After examining the isotopic signatures of δ13C-CH4 across the sediment and water column, it became apparent that the surface water δ13C-CH4 values observed in areas with thermal stratification could not be explained by diffusion, advective fluxes, nor production in the water column. In fact, these values bore a remarkable resemblance to those detected below the SMTZ. This supports the hypothesis that the source of CH4 in surface waters is more likely to originate from ebullition than diffusion in stratified brackish coastal systems.",

    "abstract": "Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is an often-fatal hyperinflammatory disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, and STXBP2. We identified a homozygous STX11 mutation, c.173T > C (p.L58P), in three patients presenting clinically with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis from unrelated Pakistani families. The mutation yields an amino acid substitution in the N-terminal Habc domain of syntaxin-11 and resulted in defective natural killer cell degranulation. Notably, syntaxin-11 expression was decreased in patient cells. However, in an ectopic expression system, syntaxin-11 L58P was expressed at levels comparable to wild-type syntaxin-11, but did not bind Munc18-2. Moreover, another N-terminal syntaxin-11 mutant, R4A, also did not bind Munc18-2. Thus, we have identified a novel missense STX11 mutation causative of FHL type 4. The syntaxin-11 R4A and L58P mutations reveal that both the N-terminus and Habc domain of syntaxin-11 are required for binding to Munc18-2, implying similarity to the dynamic binary binding of neuronal syntaxin-1 to Munc18-1.",

    "abstract": "Pneumococcal serotypes are represented by a varying number of clonal lineages with different genetic contents, potentially affecting invasiveness. However, genetic variation within the same genetic lineage may be larger than anticipated.\n\nA total of 715 invasive and carriage isolates from children in the same region and during the same period were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. Bacterial genome sequencing, functional assays, and in vivo virulence mice studies were performed.\n\nClonal types of the same serotype but also intraclonal variants within clonal complexes (CCs) showed differences in invasive-disease potential. CC138, a common CC, was divided into several PFGE patterns, partly explained by number, location, and type of temperate bacteriophages. Whole-genome sequencing of 4 CC138 isolates representing PFGE clones with different invasive-disease potentials revealed intraclonal sequence variations of the virulence-associated proteins pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and pneumococcal choline-binding protein C (PspC). A carrier isolate lacking PcpA exhibited decreased virulence in mice, and there was a differential binding of human factor H, depending on invasiveness.\n\nPneumococcal clonal types but also intraclonal variants exhibited different invasive-disease potentials in children. Intraclonal variants, reflecting different prophage contents, showed differences in major surface antigens. This suggests ongoing immune selection, such as that due to PspC-mediated complement resistance through varied human factor H binding, that may affect invasiveness in children.",

    "abstract": "Foliar fungi on urban trees are important for tree health, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Yet, we lack insights into how urbanization influences foliar fungal communities. We created detailed maps of Stockholm region's climate and air quality and characterized foliar fungi from mature oaks (Quercus robur) across climatic, air quality and local habitat gradients. Fungal richness was higher in locations with high growing season relative humidity, and fungal community composition was structured by growing season maximum temperature, NO2 concentration and leaf litter cover. The relative abundance of mycoparasites and endophytes increased with temperature. The relative abundance of pathogens was lowest with high concentrations of NO2 and particulate matter (PM2.5), while saprotrophs increased with leaf litter cover. Our findings show that urbanization influences foliar fungi, providing insights for developing management guidelines to promote tree health, prevent disease outbreaks and maintain biodiversity within urban landscapes.",

    "title": "Genome-Scale Mapping Reveals Complex Regulatory Activities of RpoN in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.",
    "abstract": "RpoN, an alternative sigma factor commonly known as σ54, is implicated in persistent stages of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infections in which genes associated with this regulator are upregulated. We here combined phenotypic and genomic assays to provide insight into its role and function in this pathogen. RpoN was found essential for Y. pseudotuberculosis virulence in mice, and in vitro functional assays showed that it controls biofilm formation and motility. Mapping genome-wide associations of Y. pseudotuberculosis RpoN using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing identified an RpoN binding motif located at 103 inter- and intragenic sites on both sense and antisense strands. Deletion of rpoN had a large impact on gene expression, including downregulation of genes encoding proteins involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. There were also clear indications of cross talk with other sigma factors, together with indirect effects due to altered expression of other regulators. Matching differential gene expression with locations of the binding sites implicated around 130 genes or operons potentially activated or repressed by RpoN. Mutagenesis of selected intergenic binding sites confirmed both positive and negative regulatory effects of RpoN binding. Corresponding mutations of intragenic sense sites had less impact on associated gene expression. Surprisingly, mutating intragenic sites on the antisense strand commonly reduced expression of genes carried by the corresponding sense strand.IMPORTANCE The alternative sigma factor RpoN (σ54), which is widely distributed in eubacteria, has been implicated in controlling gene expression of importance for numerous functions including virulence. Proper responses to host environments are crucial for bacteria to establish infection, and regulatory mechanisms involved are therefore of high interest for development of future therapeutics. Little is known about the function of RpoN in the intestinal pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis, and we therefore investigated its regulatory role in this pathogen. This regulator was indeed found to be critical for establishment of infection in mice, likely involving its requirement for motility and biofilm formation. The RpoN regulon involved both activating and suppressive effects on gene expression which could be confirmed with mutagenesis of identified binding sites. This is the first study of its kind of RpoN in Y. pseudotuberculosis, revealing complex regulation of gene expression involving both productive and silent effects of its binding to DNA, providing important information about RpoN regulation in enterobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (eIF4A3), a core helicase component of the exon junction complex, is essential for splicing, mRNA trafficking, and nonsense-mediated decay processes emerging as targets in cancer therapy. Here, we unravel eIF4A3's tumor-promoting function by demonstrating its role in ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and p53 (de)regulation. Mechanistically, eIF4A3 resides in nucleoli within the small subunit processome and regulates rRNA processing via R-loop clearance. EIF4A3 depletion induces cell cycle arrest through impaired RiBi checkpoint-mediated p53 induction and reprogrammed translation of cell cycle regulators. Multilevel omics analysis following eIF4A3 depletion pinpoints pathways of cell death regulation and translation of alternative mouse double minute homolog 2 (MDM2) transcript isoforms that control p53. EIF4A3 expression and subnuclear localization among clinical cancer specimens correlate with the RiBi status rendering eIF4A3 an exploitable vulnerability in high-RiBi tumors. We propose a concept of eIF4A3's unexpected role in RiBi, with implications for cancer pathogenesis and treatment.",

    "title": "Moose genomes reveal past glacial demography and the origin of modern lineages.",
    "abstract": "Numerous megafauna species from northern latitudes went extinct during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition as a result of climate-induced habitat changes. However, several ungulate species managed to successfully track their habitats during this period to eventually flourish and recolonise the holarctic regions. So far, the genomic impacts of these climate fluctuations on ungulates from high latitudes have been little explored. Here, we assemble a de-novo genome for the European moose (Alces alces) and analyse it together with re-sequenced nuclear genomes and ancient and modern mitogenomes from across the moose range in Eurasia and North America.\r\n\r\nWe found that moose demographic history was greatly influenced by glacial cycles, with demographic responses to the Pleistocene/Holocene transition similar to other temperate ungulates. Our results further support that modern moose lineages trace their origin back to populations that inhabited distinct glacial refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Finally, we found that present day moose in Europe and North America show low to moderate inbreeding levels resulting from post-glacial bottlenecks and founder effects, but no evidence for recent inbreeding resulting from human-induced population declines.\r\n\r\nTaken together, our results highlight the dynamic recent evolutionary history of the moose and provide an important resource for further genomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous regulation of the intestine requires the combined activity of functionally distinct neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS). However, the variety of enteric neuron types and how they emerge during development remain largely unknown. Here, we define a molecular taxonomy of 12 enteric neuron classes within the myenteric plexus of the mouse small intestine using single-cell RNA sequencing. We present cell-cell communication features and histochemical markers for motor neurons, sensory neurons and interneurons, together with transgenic tools for class-specific targeting. Transcriptome analysis of the embryonic ENS uncovers a novel principle of neuronal diversification, where two neuron classes arise through a binary neurogenic branching and all other identities emerge through subsequent postmitotic differentiation. We identify generic and class-specific transcriptional regulators and functionally connect Pbx3 to a postmitotic fate transition. Our results offer a conceptual and molecular resource for dissecting ENS circuits and predicting key regulators for directed differentiation of distinct enteric neuron classes.",

Here, we demonstrate the presence of a Troy (Tnfrsf19)-expressing progenitor subpopulation localized to defined regions along the mouse esophageal axis. Lineage tracing and mathematical modeling demonstrate that Troy-positive progenitor cells are prone to undergoing symmetrical fate choices and contribute to esophageal tissue homeostasis long term. Functionally, TROY inhibits progenitor proliferation and enables commitment to differentiation without affecting fate symmetry. Whereas Troy expression is stable during esophageal homeostasis, progenitor cells downregulate Troy in response to tissue stress, enabling proliferative expansion of basal cells refractory to differentiation and reestablishment of tissue homeostasis. Our results demonstrate functional, spatially restricted progenitor heterogeneity in the esophageal epithelium and identify how dynamic regulation of Troy coordinates tissue generation.",

    "title": "High-density linkage maps and chromosome level genome assemblies unveil direction and frequency of extensive structural rearrangements in wood white butterflies (Leptidea spp.).",
    "abstract": "Karyotypes are generally conserved between closely related species and large chromosome rearrangements typically have negative fitness consequences in heterozygotes, potentially driving speciation. In the order Lepidoptera, most investigated species have the ancestral karyotype and gene synteny is often conserved across deep divergence, although examples of extensive genome reshuffling have recently been demonstrated. The genus Leptidea has an unusual level of chromosome variation and rearranged sex chromosomes, but the extent of restructuring across the rest of the genome is so far unknown. To explore the genomes of the wood white (Leptidea) species complex, we generated eight genome assemblies using a combination of 10X linked reads and HiC data, and improved them using linkage maps for two populations of the common wood white (L. sinapis) with distinct karyotypes. Synteny analysis revealed an extensive amount of rearrangements, both compared to the ancestral karyotype and between the Leptidea species, where only one of the three Z chromosomes was conserved across all comparisons. Most restructuring was explained by fissions and fusions, while translocations appear relatively rare. We further detected several examples of segregating rearrangement polymorphisms supporting a highly dynamic genome evolution in this clade. Fusion breakpoints were enriched for LINEs and LTR elements, which suggests that ectopic recombination might be an important driver in the formation of new chromosomes. Our results show that chromosome count alone may conceal the extent of genome restructuring and we propose that the amount of genome evolution in Lepidoptera might still be underestimated due to lack of taxonomic sampling.",

    "abstract": "Clonal deconvolution of mutational landscapes is crucial to understand the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. Two limiting factors for clonal deconvolution that have remained unresolved are variation in purity and chromosomal copy number across different samples of the same tumor. We developed a semi-supervised algorithm that tracks variant calls through multi-sample spatiotemporal tumor data. While normalizing allele frequencies based on purity, it also adjusts for copy number changes at clonal deconvolution. Absent à priori copy number data, it renders in silico copy number estimations from bulk sequences. Using published and simulated tumor sequences, we reliably segregated clonal/subclonal variants even at a low sequencing depth (~50×). Given at least one pure tumor sample (>70% purity), we could normalize and deconvolve paired samples down to a purity of 40%. This renders a reliable clonal reconstruction well adapted to multi-regionally sampled solid tumors, which are often aneuploid and contaminated by non-cancer cells.",

    "title": "The Population History of Domestic Sheep Revealed by Paleogenomes.",
    "abstract": "Sheep was one of the first domesticated animals in Neolithic West Eurasia. The zooarchaeological record suggests that domestication first took place in Southwest Asia, although much remains unresolved about the precise location(s) and timing(s) of earliest domestication, or the post-domestication history of sheep. Here, we present 24 new partial sheep paleogenomes, including a 13,000-year-old Epipaleolithic Central Anatolian wild sheep, as well as 14 domestic sheep from Neolithic Anatolia, two from Neolithic Iran, two from Neolithic Iberia, three from Neolithic France, and one each from Late Neolithic/Bronze Age Baltic and South Russia, in addition to five present-day Central Anatolian Mouflons and two present-day Cyprian Mouflons. We find that Neolithic European, as well as domestic sheep breeds, are genetically closer to the Anatolian Epipaleolithic sheep and the present-day Anatolian and Cyprian Mouflon than to the Iranian Mouflon. This supports a Central Anatolian source for domestication, presenting strong evidence for a domestication event in SW Asia outside the Fertile Crescent, although we cannot rule out multiple domestication events also within the Neolithic Fertile Crescent. We further find evidence for multiple admixture and replacement events, including one that parallels the Pontic Steppe-related ancestry expansion in Europe, as well as a post-Bronze Age event that appears to have further spread Asia-related alleles across global sheep breeds. Our findings mark the dynamism of past domestic sheep populations in their potential for dispersal and admixture, sometimes being paralleled by their shepherds and in other cases not.",

    "title": "Distinct origin and region-dependent contribution of stromal fibroblasts to fibrosis following traumatic injury in mice.",
    "abstract": "Fibrotic scar tissue formation occurs in humans and mice. The fibrotic scar impairs tissue regeneration and functional recovery. However, the origin of scar-forming fibroblasts is unclear. Here, we show that stromal fibroblasts forming the fibrotic scar derive from two populations of perivascular cells after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult mice of both sexes. We anatomically and transcriptionally identify the two cell populations as pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts. Fibroblasts and pericytes are enriched in the white and gray matter regions of the spinal cord, respectively. Both cell populations are recruited in response to SCI and inflammation. However, their contribution to fibrotic scar tissue depends on the location of the lesion. Upon injury, pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts become activated and transcriptionally converge on the generation of stromal myofibroblasts. Our results show that pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts contribute to the fibrotic scar in a region-dependent manner.",

    "title": "The human bone marrow plasma cell compartment in rheumatoid arthritis - Clonal relationships and anti-citrulline autoantibody producing cells.",
    "abstract": "A majority of circulating IgG is produced by plasma cells residing in the bone marrow (BM). Long-lived BM plasma cells constitute our humoral immune memory and are essential for infection-specific immunity. They may also provide a reservoir of potentially pathogenic autoantibodies, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies (ACPA). Here we investigated paired human BM plasma cell and peripheral blood (PB) B-cell repertoires in seropositive RA, four ACPA+ RA patients and one ACPA- using two different single-cell approaches, flow cytometry sorting, and transcriptomics, followed by recombinant antibody generation. Immunoglobulin (Ig) analysis of >900 paired heavy-light chains from BM plasma cells identified by either surface CD138 expression or transcriptome profiles (including gene expression of MZB1, JCHAIN and XBP1) demonstrated differences in IgG/A repertoires and N-linked glycosylation between patients. For three patients, we identified clonotypes shared between BM plasma cells and PB memory B cells. Notably, four individuals displayed plasma cells with identical heavy chains but different light chains, which may indicate receptor revision or clonal convergence. ACPA-producing BM plasma cells were identified in two ACPA+ patients. Three of 44 recombinantly expressed monoclonal antibodies from ACPA+ RA BM plasma cells were CCP2+, specifically binding to citrullinated peptides. Out of these, two clones reacted with citrullinated histone-4 and activated neutrophils. In conclusion, single-cell investigation of B-cell repertoires in RA bone marrow provided new understanding of human plasma cells clonal relationships and demonstrated pathogenically relevant disease-associated autoantibody expression in long-lived plasma cells.",

    "abstract": "The Plasmodium falciparum life cycle includes obligate transition between a human and mosquito host. Gametocytes are responsible for transmission from the human to the mosquito vector where gamete fusion followed by meiosis occurs. To elucidate how male and female gametocytes differentiate in the absence of sex chromosomes, we perform FACS-based cell enrichment of a P. falciparum gametocyte reporter line followed by single-cell RNA-seq. In our analyses we define the transcriptional programs and predict candidate driver genes underlying male and female development, including genes from the ApiAP2 family of transcription factors. A motif-driven, gene regulatory network analysis indicates that AP2-G5 specifically modulates male development. Additionally, genes linked to the inner membrane complex, involved in morphological changes, are uniquely expressed in the female lineage. The transcriptional programs of male and female development detailed herein allow for further exploration of the evolution of sex in eukaryotes and provide targets for future development of transmission blocking therapies.",

    "title": "Shared requirement for MYC upstream super-enhancer region in tissue regeneration and cancer.",
    "abstract": "Cancer has been characterized as a wound that does not heal. Malignant cells are morphologically distinct from normal proliferating cells but have extensive similarities to tissues undergoing wound healing and/or regeneration. The mechanistic basis of this similarity has, however, remained enigmatic. Here, we show that the genomic region upstream of Myc, which carries more cancer susceptibility in humans than any other genomic region, is required for intestinal regeneration after radiation damage. Failure to regenerate is associated with inefficient Ly6a/Sca1+ stem/progenitor cell mobilization, and almost complete failure to re-establish Lgr5+ cell compartment in the intestinal crypts. The Myc upstream region is also critical for growth of adult intestinal cells in 3D organoid culture. We show that culture conditions recapitulating most aspects of adult normal tissue architecture still reprogram normal cells to proliferate using a mechanism similar to that employed by cancer cells. Our results establish a function for the Myc super-enhancer region as the genetic link between tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis, and demonstrates that normal tissue renewal and regeneration of tissues after severe damage are mechanistically distinct.2-540",

    "title": "Spatial transcriptomics unveils estrogen-modulated immune responses and structural alterations in the ectocervical mucosa of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate users.",
    "abstract": "The injectable contraceptive, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), is associated with compromised cervical mucosal barriers. High-resolution spatial transcriptomics is applied here to reveal the spatial localization of these altered molecular markers. Ectocervical tissue samples from Kenyan sex workers using DMPA, or non-hormonal contraceptives, underwent spatial transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analyses. Integrated systemic estradiol levels and bulk tissue gene expression data from a larger cohort enhanced the study's scope. Unsupervised clustering unveiled four epithelial and seven submucosal layers, showcasing spatially restricted and diverse functional epithelial responses, and a less structured submucosal spatial ordering. DMPA associated with mucosal-wide immunoglobulin gene upregulation, verified by CD20+ B-cell immunostaining, and upregulated immune markers adjacent to the basal membrane. Downregulated genes represented spatially restricted disrupted epithelial barrier integrity and submucosal extracellular matrix dysfunction. The transcriptional profile was associated with markers of estrogen regulation. Collectively, our findings reveal estrogen-modulated distinct ectocervical transcriptional profiles associated with DMPA usage. While upregulation of immunoglobulin genes occurs throughout the mucosa, activation of innate immune responses and dysregulation of barrier integrity markers are spatially restricted. These results extend previous analyses using bulk transcriptomics and provide insights into the molecular landscape influenced by DMPA, shedding light on contraceptive effects and health implications.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the red clover (Trifolium pratense) root-associated microbiota to clarify the presence of pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms in 89 Swedish field sites.\r\n\r\n16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing analysis were performed on DNA extracted from the red clover root samples collected to determine the composition of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic root-associated microbe communities. Alpha and beta diversities were calculated and relative abundance of various microbial taxa and their co-occurrence were analyzed. Rhizobium was the most prevalent bacterial genus, followed by Sphingomonas, Mucilaginibacter, Flavobacterium, and the unclassified Chloroflexi group KD4-96. The Leptodontidium, Cladosporium, Clonostachys, and Tetracladium fungal genera known for endophytic, saprotrophic, and mycoparasitic lifestyles were also frequently observed in all samples. Sixty-two potential pathogenic fungi were identified with a bias toward grass pathogens and a higher abundance in samples from conventional farms.\r\n\r\nWe showed that the microbial community was mainly shaped by geographic location and management procedures. Co-occurrence networks revealed that the Rhizobiumleguminosarum bv. trifolii was negatively associated with all fungal pathogenic taxa recognized in this study.",

    "abstract": "Oculomotor neurons, which regulate eye movement, are resilient to degeneration in the lethal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It would be highly advantageous if motor neuron resilience could be modeled in vitro. Toward this goal, we generated a high proportion of oculomotor neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells through temporal overexpression of PHOX2A in neuronal progenitors. We demonstrate, using electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing, that in vitro-generated neurons are bona fide oculomotor neurons based on their cellular properties and similarity to their in vivo counterpart in rodent and man. We also show that in vitro-generated oculomotor neurons display a robust activation of survival-promoting Akt signaling and are more resilient to the ALS-like toxicity of kainic acid than spinal motor neurons. Thus, we can generate bona fide oculomotor neurons in vitro that display a resilience similar to that seen in vivo.",

    "title": "Unravelling reference bias in ancient DNA datasets.",
    "abstract": "The alignment of sequencing reads is a critical step in the characterization of ancient genomes. However, reference bias and spurious mappings pose a significant challenge, particularly as cutting-edge wet lab methods generate datasets that push the boundaries of alignment tools. Reference bias occurs when reference alleles are favoured over alternative alleles during mapping, whereas spurious mappings stem from either contamination or when endogenous reads fail to align to their correct position. Previous work has shown that these phenomena are correlated with read length but a more thorough investigation of reference bias and spurious mappings for ancient DNA has been lacking. Here, we use a range of empirical and simulated palaeogenomic datasets to investigate the impacts of mapping tools, quality thresholds, and reference genome on mismatch rates across read lengths.\n\nFor these analyses, we introduce AMBER, a new bioinformatics tool for assessing the quality of ancient DNA mapping directly from BAM-files and informing on reference bias, read length cut-offs and reference selection. AMBER rapidly and simultaneously computes the sequence read mapping bias in the form of the mismatch rates per read length, cytosine deamination profiles at both CpG and non-CpG sites, fragment length distributions, and genomic breadth and depth of coverage. Using AMBER, we find that mapping algorithms and quality threshold choices dictate reference bias and rates of spurious alignment at different read lengths in a predictable manner, suggesting that optimized mapping parameters for each read length will be a key step in alleviating reference bias and spurious mappings.\n\nAMBER is available for noncommercial use on GitHub (https://github.com/tvandervalk/AMBER.git). Scripts used to generate and analyse simulated datasets are available on Github (https://github.com/sdolenz/refbias_scripts).",

    "title": "RNA silencing proteins and small RNAs in oomycete plant pathogens and biocontrol agents.",
    "abstract": "Oomycetes cause several damaging diseases of plants and animals, and some species also act as biocontrol agents on insects, fungi, and other oomycetes. RNA silencing is increasingly being shown to play a role in the pathogenicity of Phytophthora species, either through trans-boundary movement of small RNAs (sRNAs) or through expression regulation of infection promoting effectors.\n\nTo gain a wider understanding of RNA silencing in oomycete species with more diverse hosts, we mined genome assemblies for Dicer-like (DCL), Argonaute (AGO), and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) proteins from Phytophthora plurivora, Ph. cactorum, Ph. colocasiae, Pythium oligandrum, Py. periplocum, and Lagenidium giganteum. Moreover, we sequenced small RNAs from the mycelium stage in each of these species.\n\nEach of the species possessed a single DCL protein, but they differed in the number and sequence of AGOs and RDRPs. SRNAs of 21nt, 25nt, and 26nt were prevalent in all oomycetes analyzed, but the relative abundance and 5' base preference of these classes differed markedly between genera. Most sRNAs mapped to transposons and other repeats, signifying that the major role for RNA silencing in oomycetes is to limit the expansion of these elements. We also found that sRNAs may act to regulate the expression of duplicated genes. Other sRNAs mapped to several gene families, and this number was higher in Pythium spp., suggesting a role of RNA silencing in regulating gene expression. Genes for most effector classes were the source of sRNAs of variable size, but some gene families showed a preference for specific classes of sRNAs, such as 25/26 nt sRNAs targeting RxLR effector genes in Phytophthora species. Novel miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) were discovered in all species, and two were predicted to target transcripts for RxLR effectors in Ph. plurivora and Ph. cactorum, indicating a putative role in regulating infection. Moreover, milRNAs from the biocontrol Pythium species had matches in the predicted transcriptome of Phytophthora infestans and Botrytis cinerea, and L. giganteum milRNAs matched candidate genes in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. This suggests that trans-boundary RNA silencing may have a role in the biocontrol action of these oomycetes.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation. Studies aiming to understand the impact of ERα on cancer-associated phenotypes have largely been limited to its transcriptional activity. Herein, we demonstrate that ERα coordinates its transcriptional output with selective modulation of mRNA translation. Importantly, translational perturbations caused by depletion of ERα largely manifest as \"translational offsetting\" of the transcriptome, whereby amounts of translated mRNAs and corresponding protein levels are maintained constant despite changes in mRNA abundance. Transcripts whose levels, but not polysome association, are reduced following ERα depletion lack features which limit translation efficiency including structured 5'UTRs and miRNA target sites. In contrast, mRNAs induced upon ERα depletion whose polysome association remains unaltered are enriched in codons requiring U34-modified tRNAs for efficient decoding. Consistently, ERα regulates levels of U34-modifying enzymes and thereby controls levels of U34-modified tRNAs. These findings unravel a hitherto unprecedented mechanism of ERα-dependent orchestration of transcriptional and translational programs that may be a pervasive mechanism of proteome maintenance in hormone-dependent cancers.",

    "title": "Distinct oligodendrocyte populations have spatial preference and different responses to spinal cord injury",
    "abstract": "Mature oligodendrocytes (MOLs) show transcriptional heterogeneity, the functional consequences of which are unclear. MOL heterogeneity might correlate with the local environment or their interactions with different neuron types. Here, we show that distinct MOL populations have spatial preference in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). We found that MOL type 2 (MOL2) is enriched in the spinal cord when compared to the brain, while MOL types 5 and 6 (MOL5/6) increase their contribution to the OL lineage with age in all analyzed regions. MOL2 and MOL5/6 also have distinct spatial preference in the spinal cord regions where motor and sensory tracts run. OL progenitor cells (OPCs) are not specified into distinct MOL populations during development, excluding a major contribution of OPC intrinsic mechanisms determining MOL heterogeneity. In disease, MOL2 and MOL5/6 present different susceptibility during the chronic phase following traumatic spinal cord injury. Our results demonstrate that the distinct MOL populations have different spatial preference and different responses to disease.",

    "abstract": "Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) are nerve-associated progenitors that can generate myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells but also are multipotent like the neural crest cells from which they originate. SCPs are omnipresent along outgrowing peripheral nerves throughout the body of vertebrate embryos. By using single-cell transcriptomics to generate a gene expression atlas of the entire neural crest lineage, we show that early SCPs and late migratory crest cells have similar transcriptional profiles characterised by a multipotent \"hub\" state containing cells biased towards traditional neural crest fates. SCPs keep diverging from the neural crest after being primed towards terminal Schwann cells and other fates, with different subtypes residing in distinct anatomical locations. Functional experiments using CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function further show that knockout of the common \"hub\" gene Sox8 causes defects in neural crest-derived cells along peripheral nerves by facilitating differentiation of SCPs towards sympathoadrenal fates. Finally, specific tumour populations found in melanoma, neurofibroma and neuroblastoma map to different stages of SCP/Schwann cell development. Overall, SCPs resemble migrating neural crest cells that maintain multipotency and become transcriptionally primed towards distinct lineages.",

    "title": "Transcriptional and metabolic rewiring of colorectal cancer cells expressing the oncogenic KRASG13D mutation.",
    "abstract": "Activating mutations in KRAS frequently occur in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, leading to resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies.\n\nTo better understand the cellular reprogramming which occurs in mutant KRAS cells, we have undertaken a systems-level analysis of four CRC cell lines which express either wild type (wt) KRAS or the oncogenic KRASG13D allele (mtKRAS).\n\nRNAseq revealed that genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, mRNA translation and metabolism were significantly upregulated in mtKRAS cells. Consistent with the transcriptional data, protein synthesis and cell proliferation were significantly higher in the mtKRAS cells. Targeted metabolomics analysis also confirmed the metabolic reprogramming in mtKRAS cells. Interestingly, mtKRAS cells were highly transcriptionally responsive to EGFR activation by TGFα stimulation, which was associated with an unexpected downregulation of genes involved in a range of anabolic processes. While TGFα treatment strongly activated protein synthesis in wtKRAS cells, protein synthesis was not activated above basal levels in the TGFα-treated mtKRAS cells. This was likely due to the defective activation of the mTORC1 and other pathways by TGFα in mtKRAS cells, which was associated with impaired activation of PKB signalling and a transient induction of AMPK signalling.\n\nWe have found that mtKRAS cells are substantially rewired at the transcriptional, translational and metabolic levels and that this rewiring may reveal new vulnerabilities in oncogenic KRAS CRC cells that could be exploited in future.",

    "title": "Systematic screens for fertility genes essential for malaria parasite transmission reveal conserved aspects of sex in a divergent eukaryote.",
    "abstract": "Sexual reproduction in malaria parasites is essential for their transmission to mosquitoes and offers a divergent eukaryote model to understand the evolution of sex. Through a panel of genetic screens in Plasmodium berghei, we identify 348 sex and transmission-related genes and define roles for unstudied genes as putative targets for transmission-blocking interventions. The functional data provide a deeper understanding of female metabolic reprogramming, meiosis, and the axoneme. We identify a complex of a SUN domain protein (SUN1) and a putative allantoicase (ALLC1) that is essential for male fertility by linking the microtubule organizing center to the nuclear envelope and enabling mitotic spindle formation during male gametogenesis. Both proteins have orthologs in mouse testis, and the data raise the possibility of an ancient role for atypical SUN domain proteins in coupling the nucleus and axoneme. Altogether, our data provide an unbiased picture of the molecular processes that underpin malaria parasite transmission. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.",

    "title": "Claudin5 protects the peripheral endothelial barrier in an organ and vessel-type-specific manner.",
    "abstract": "Dysfunctional and leaky blood vessels resulting from disruption of the endothelial cell (EC) barrier accompanies numerous diseases. The EC barrier is established through endothelial cell tight and adherens junctions. However, the expression pattern and precise contribution of different junctional proteins to the EC barrier is poorly understood. Here, we focus on organs with continuous endothelium to identify structural and functional in vivo characteristics of the EC barrier. Assembly of multiple single-cell RNAseq datasets into a single integrated database revealed the variability and commonalities of EC barrier patterning. Across tissues, Claudin5 exhibited diminishing expression along the arteriovenous axis, correlating with EC barrier integrity. Functional analysis identified tissue-specific differences in leakage properties and response to the leakage agonist histamine. Loss of Claudin5 enhanced histamine-induced leakage in an organotypic and vessel type-specific manner in an inducible, EC-specific, knock-out mouse. Mechanistically, Claudin5 loss left junction ultrastructure unaffected but altered its composition, with concomitant loss of zonula occludens-1 and upregulation of VE-Cadherin expression. These findings uncover the organ-specific organisation of the EC barrier and distinct importance of Claudin5 in different vascular beds, providing insights to modify EC barrier stability in a targeted, organ-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Sterile inflammation after injury is important for tissue restoration. In injured human and mouse tissues, macrophages were recently found to accumulate perivascularly. This study investigates if macrophages adopt a mural cell phenotype important for restoration after ischemic injury. Single-cell RNA sequencing of fate-mapped macrophages from ischemic mouse muscles demonstrates a macrophage-toward-mural cell switch of a subpopulation of macrophages with downregulated myeloid cell genes and upregulated mural cell genes, including PDGFRβ. This observation was further strengthened when including unspliced transcripts in the analysis. The macrophage switch was proven functionally relevant, as induction of macrophage-specific PDGFRβ deficiency prevented their perivascular macrophage phenotype, impaired vessel maturation and increased vessel leakiness, which ultimately reduced limb function. In conclusion, macrophages in adult ischemic tissue were demonstrated to undergo a cellular program to morphologically, transcriptomically and functionally resemble mural cells while weakening their macrophage identity. The macrophage-to-mural cell-like phenotypic switch is crucial for restoring tissue function and warrants further exploration as a potential target for immunotherapies to enhance healing.",

    "title": "A transposable element insertion is associated with an alternative life history strategy.",
    "abstract": "Tradeoffs affect resource allocation during development and result in fitness consequences that drive the evolution of life history strategies. Yet despite their importance, we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs. Many species of Colias butterflies exhibit an alternative life history strategy (ALHS) where females divert resources from wing pigment synthesis to reproductive and somatic development. Due to this reallocation, a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS: either yellow/orange or white. Here we map the locus associated with this ALHS in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion located downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1, a homeobox transcription factor. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, antibody staining, and electron microscopy we find white-specific expression of BarH-1 suppresses the formation of pigment granules in wing scales and gives rise to white wing color. Lipid and transcriptome analyses reveal physiological differences associated with the ALHS. Together, these findings characterize a mechanism for a female-limited ALHS.",

    "abstract": "The human methyltransferase and transcriptional coactivator MLL4 and its paralog MLL3 are frequently mutated in cancer. MLL4 and MLL3 monomethylate histone H3K4 and contain a set of uncharacterized PHD fingers. Here, we report a novel function of the PHD2 and PHD3 (PHD2/3) fingers of MLL4 and MLL3 that bind to ASXL2, a component of the Polycomb repressive H2AK119 deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex. The structure of MLL4 PHD2/3 in complex with the MLL-binding helix (MBH) of ASXL2 and mutational analyses reveal the molecular mechanism which is conserved in homologous ASXL1 and ASXL3. The native interaction of the Trithorax MLL3/4 complexes with the PR-DUB complex in vivo depends solely on MBH of ASXL1/2, coupling the two histone modifying activities. ChIP-seq analysis in embryonic stem cells demonstrates that MBH of ASXL1/2 is required for the deubiquitinase BAP1 recruitment to MLL4-bound active enhancers. Our findings suggest an ASXL1/2-dependent functional link between the MLL3/4 and PR-DUB complexes.",

    "title": "Evaluation of exome sequencing to estimate tumor burden in plasma.",
    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of systemic tumor load from the blood of cancer patients has enormous potential. One avenue is to measure the presence of cell-free circulating tumor DNA in plasma. Various approaches have been investigated, predominantly covering hotspot mutations or customized, patient-specific assays. Therefore, we investigated the utility of using exome sequencing to monitor circulating tumor DNA levels through the detection of single nucleotide variants in plasma. Two technologies, claiming to offer efficient library preparation from nanogram levels of DNA, were evaluated. This allowed us to estimate the proportion of starting molecules measurable by sequence capture (<5%). As cell-free DNA is highly fragmented, we designed and provide software for efficient identification of PCR duplicates in single-end libraries with a varying size distribution. On average, this improved sequence coverage by 38% in comparison to standard tools. By exploiting the redundant information in PCR-duplicates the background noise was reduced to ∼1/35,000. By applying our optimized analysis pipeline to a simulation analysis, we determined the current sensitivity limit to ∼1/2400, starting with 30 ng of cell-free DNA. Subsequently, circulating tumor DNA levels were assessed in seven breast- and one prostate cancer patient. One patient carried detectable levels of circulating tumor DNA, as verified by break-point specific PCR. These results demonstrate exome sequencing on cell-free DNA to be a powerful tool for disease monitoring of metastatic cancers. To enable a broad implementation in the diagnostic settings, the efficiency limitations of sequence capture and the inherent noise levels of the Illumina sequencing technology must be further improved.",

    "title": "Cytoskeletal alterations in neuronal cells implicate Toxoplasma gondii secretory machinery and host microRNA-containing extracellular vesicles.",
    "abstract": "The widespread protozoan Toxoplasma gondii chronically infects neural tissue in vertebrates and is linked to various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. However, its effects on sparsely infected neurons and on broader neural circuits remain elusive. Our study reveals that T. gondii infection disrupts cytoskeletal dynamics in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and primary cortical neurons. Infected neuronal cells undergo significant cytomorphological changes, including retraction of dendritic extensions and alterations in microtubule and F-actin networks, across both parasite genotypes I and II. These cytoskeletal alterations were notably diminished in cells exposed to T. gondii mutants with impaired secretion via the MYR translocon, and were independent of intraneuronal parasite replication. Moreover, a bystander effect was observed, with supernatants from T. gondii-challenged cells inducing similar cytoskeletal changes in uninfected cells. Analyses of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in supernatants revealed differential expression of host microRNAs in response to infection, most notably the upregulation of miR-221-3p, a microRNA not previously associated with T. gondii. The data indicate that unidentified parasite-derived effector(s) secreted via the MYR translocon, in conjunction with MYR-independently induced EV-associated host microRNAs, mediate cytoskeletal alterations in both infected and bystander neuronal cells. The findings provide new insights into molecular mechanisms by which T. gondii infection may disrupt neural networks, shedding light on its potential role in neuronal dysregulation.",

    "title": "Different mutations in PDE4D associated with developmental disorders with mirror phenotypes.",
    "abstract": "Point mutations in PDE4D have been recently linked to acrodysostosis, an autosomal dominant disorder with skeletal dysplasia, severe brachydactyly, midfacial hypoplasia and intellectual disability. The purpose of the present study was to investigate clinical and cellular implications of different types of mutations in the PDE4D gene.\n\nWe studied five acrodysostosis patients and three patients with gene dose imbalances involving PDE4D clinically and by whole exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing and array comparative hybridisation. To evaluate the functional consequences of the PDE4D changes, we used overexpression of mutated human PDE4D message and morpholino-based suppression of pde4d in zebrafish.\n\nWe identified three novel and two previously described PDE4D point mutations in the acrodysostosis patients and two deletions and one duplication involving PDE4D in three patients suffering from an intellectual disability syndrome with low body mass index, long fingers, toes and arms, prominent nose and small chin. When comparing symptoms in patients with missense mutations and gene dose imbalances involving PDE4D, a mirror phenotype was observed. By comparing overexpression of human mutated transcripts with pde4d knockdown in zebrafish embryos, we could successfully assay the pathogenicity of the mutations.\n\nOur findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of PDE4D results in a novel intellectual disability syndrome, the 5q12.1-haploinsufficiency syndrome, with several opposing features compared with acrodysostosis that is caused by dominant negative mutations. In addition, our results expand the spectrum of PDE4D mutations underlying acrodysostosis and indicate that, in contrast to previous reports, patients with PDE4D mutations may have significant hormone resistance with consequent endocrine abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the milk microbiota during the course of mastitis are due to the nature of a sporadic occurring disease difficult to study. In this study we experimentally induced mastitis by infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxins in one udder quarter each of nine healthy lactating dairy cows and assessed the bacteriological dynamics and the milk microbiota at four time points before and eight time points after infusion. As control, saline was infused in one udder quarter each of additionally nine healthy cows that followed the same sampling protocol. The milk microbiota was assessed by sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and a range of positive and negative controls were included for methodological evaluation. Two different data filtration models were used to identify and cure data from contaminating taxa. Endotoxin infused quarters responded with transient clinical signs of inflammation and increased SCC while no response was observed in the control cows. In the milk microbiota data no response to inflammation was identified. The data analysis of the milk microbiota was largely hampered by laboratory and reagent contamination. Application of the filtration models caused a marked reduction in data but did not reveal any associations with the inflammatory reaction. Our results indicate that the microbiota in milk from healthy cows is unaffected by inflammation.",

    "abstract": "B cells play a significant role in established Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). However, it is unclear to what extent differentiated B cells are present in joint tissue already at the onset of disease. Here, we studied synovial biopsies (n = 8) captured from untreated patients at time of diagnosis. 3414 index-sorted B cells underwent RNA sequencing and paired tissue pieces were subjected to spatial transcriptomics (n = 4). We performed extensive bioinformatics analyses to dissect the local B cell composition. Select plasma cell immunoglobulin sequences were expressed as monoclonal antibodies and tested by ELISA. Memory and plasma cells were found irrespective of autoantibody status of the patients. Double negative memory B cells were prominent, but did not display a distinct transcriptional profile. The tissue architecture implicate both local B cell maturation via T cell help and plasma cell survival niches with a strong CXCL12-CXCR4 axis. The immunoglobulin sequence analyses revealed clonality between the memory B and plasma cell pools further supporting local maturation. One of the plasma cell-derived antibodies displayed citrulline autoreactivity, demonstrating local autoreactive plasma cell differentiation in joint biopsies captured from untreated early RA. Hence, plasma cell niches are not a consequence of chronic inflammation, but are already present at the time of diagnosis.",

    "title": "Speciation in savanna birds in South America: The case of the Least Nighthawk Chordeiles pusillus (Aves: Caprimulgidae) in and out of the Amazon.",
    "abstract": "The Least Nighthawk Chordeiles pusillus is widespread wherever there are savannas in the South American tropics, often in isolated patches, such as white-sands savannas in the Amazon rainforest realm. Here, we investigate genetic relationships between populations of the Least Nighthawk to understand historical processes leading to its diversification and to determine dispersal routes between northern and southern savannas by way of three hypothesized dispersal corridors by comparing samples from white-sand savannas to samples from other savannas outside of the Amazon rainforest region. We use 32 mtDNA samples from the range of C. pusillus to infer a dated phylogeny. In a subset of 17 samples, we use shotgun sequences to infer a distance-based phylogeny and to estimate individual admixture proportions. We calculate gene flow and shared alleles between white-sand and non-Amazonian populations using the ABBA-BABA test (D statistics), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to examine genetic structure within and between lineages. Finally, we use species distribution modelling (SDM) of conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), currently, and in the future (2050-2080) to predict potential species occurrence under a climate change scenario. Two main clades (estimated to have diverged around 1.07 million years ago) were recovered with mtDNA sequences and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) and were supported by NGSadmix and PCA: one in the Amazon basin white-sand savannas, the other in the non-Amazonian savannas. Possible allele sharing between these clades was indicated by the D-statistics between northern non-Amazonian populations and the white-sand savanna population, but this was not corroborated by the admixture analyses. Dispersal among northern non-Amazonian populations may have occurred in a dry corridor between the Guianan and the Brazilian Shield, which has since moved eastward. Our data suggest that the lineages separated well before the Last Glacial Maximum, consequently dispersal could have happened at any earlier time during similar climatic conditions. Subsequently, non-Amazonian lineages became more divergent among themselves, possibly connecting and dispersing across the mouth of the Amazon River across Marajó island during favourable climatic conditions in the Pleistocene.",

    "title": "The super-pangenome of Populus unveils genomic facets for its adaptation and diversification in widespread forest trees.",
    "abstract": "Understanding the underlying mechanisms and links between genome evolution and adaptive innovations stands as a key goal in evolutionary studies. Poplars, among the world's most widely distributed and cultivated trees, exhibit extensive phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a genus-level super-pangenome comprising 19 Populus genomes, revealing the likely pivotal role of private genes in facilitating local environmental and climate adaptation. Through the integration of pangenomes with transcriptomes, methylomes, and chromatin accessibility mapping, we unveil that the evolutionary trajectories of pangenes and duplicated genes are closely linked to local genomic landscapes of regulatory and epigenetic architectures, notably CG methylation in gene-body regions. Further comparative genomic analyses have enabled the identification of 142 202 structural variants across species that intersect with a significant number of genes and contribute substantially to both phenotypic and adaptive divergence. We have experimentally validated a ∼180-bp presence/absence variant affecting the expression of the CUC2 gene, crucial for leaf serration formation. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web-based tool encompassing the multi-omics resources associated with the Populus super-pangenome (http://www.populus-superpangenome.com). Together, the present pioneering super-pangenome resource in forest trees not only aids in the advancement of breeding efforts of this globally important tree genus but also offers valuable insights into potential avenues for comprehending tree biology.",

    "title": "Identification of candidate genetic variants and altered protein expression in neural stem and mature neural cells support altered microtubule function to be an essential component in bipolar disorder.",
    "abstract": "Identification of causative genetic variants leading to the development of bipolar disorder (BD) could result in genetic tests that would facilitate diagnosis. A better understanding of affected genes and pathways is also necessary for targeting of genes that may improve treatment strategies. To date several susceptibility genes have been reported from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but little is known about specific variants that affect disease development. Here, we performed quantitative proteomics and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Quantitative proteomics revealed NLRP2 as the most significantly up-regulated protein in neural stem cells and mature neural cells obtained from BD-patient cell samples. These results are in concordance with our previously published transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, the levels of FEZ2 and CADM2 proteins were also significantly differentially expressed in BD compared to control derived cells. The levels of FEZ2 were significantly downregulated in neural stem cells (NSC) while CADM2 was significantly up-regulated in mature neuronal cell culture. Promising novel candidate mutations were identified in the ANK3, NEK3, NEK7, TUBB, ANKRD1, and BRD2 genes. A literature search of candidate variants and deregulated proteins revealed that there are several connections to microtubule function for the molecules putatively involved. Microtubule function in neurons is critical for axon structure and axonal transport. A functional dynamic microtubule is also needed for an advocate response to cellular and environmental stress. If microtubule dynamics is compromised by mutations, it could be followed by deregulated expression forming a possible explanation for the inherited vulnerability to stressful life events that have been proposed to trigger mood episodes in BD patients.",

    "title": "Genome analyses suggest recent speciation and postglacial isolation in the Norwegian lemming.",
    "abstract": "The Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) is a small rodent distributed across the Fennoscandian mountain tundra and the Kola Peninsula. The Norwegian lemming likely evolved during the Late Pleistocene and inhabited Fennoscandia shortly prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. However, the exact timing and origins of the species, and its phylogenetic position relative to the closely related Siberian lemming (Lemmus sibiricus) remain disputed. Moreover, the presence of ancient or contemporary gene flow between both species is largely untested. The Norwegian lemming displays characteristic phenotypic and behavioral adaptations (e.g., coat color, aggression) that are not present in other Lemmus species. We generated a de novo genome assembly for the Norwegian lemming and resequenced nine modern and two ancient Lemmus spp. genomes. We show that all Lemmus species form distinct monophyletic clades, with concordant topology between the mitochondrial and nuclear genome phylogenies. The Siberian lemming is divided into two distinct but paraphyletic clades, one in the east and one in the west, where the western clade represents a sister taxon to the Norwegian lemming. We estimate that the Norwegian and western Siberian lemming diverged shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum, making the Norwegian lemming one of the youngest known mammalian species. We did not find any indication of gene flow between L. lemmus and L. sibiricus, suggesting postglacial isolation of L. lemmus. Furthermore, we identify species-specific genomic differences in genes related to coat color and fat transport, which are likely associated with the distinctive coloration and overwintering behavior observed in the Norwegian lemming.",

    "title": "PopulusPtERF85 Balances Xylem Cell Expansion and Secondary Cell Wall Formation in Hybrid Aspen.",
    "abstract": "Secondary growth relies on precise and specialized transcriptional networks that determine cell division, differentiation, and maturation of xylem cells. We identified a novel role for the ethylene-induced Populus Ethylene Response Factor PtERF85 (Potri.015G023200) in balancing xylem cell expansion and secondary cell wall (SCW) formation in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x tremuloides). Expression of PtERF85 is high in phloem and cambium cells and during the expansion of xylem cells, while it is low in maturing xylem tissue. Extending PtERF85 expression into SCW forming zones of woody tissues through ectopic expression reduced wood density and SCW thickness of xylem fibers but increased fiber diameter. Xylem transcriptomes from the transgenic trees revealed transcriptional induction of genes involved in cell expansion, translation, and growth. The expression of genes associated with plant vascular development and the biosynthesis of SCW chemical components such as xylan and lignin, was down-regulated in the transgenic trees. Our results suggest that PtERF85 activates genes related to xylem cell expansion, while preventing transcriptional activation of genes related to SCW formation. The importance of precise spatial expression of PtERF85 during wood development together with the observed phenotypes in response to ectopic PtERF85 expression suggests that PtERF85 contributes to the transition of fiber cells from elongation to secondary cell wall deposition.",
